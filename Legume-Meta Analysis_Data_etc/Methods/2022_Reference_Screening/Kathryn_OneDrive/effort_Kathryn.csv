In total, 361 isolates were obtained from Mimosa pudica and Mimosa diplotricha in 25 locations. A multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) including 16S rRNA, atpD, dnaK, glnA, gyrB, and recA identified the isolates into eight genospecies corresponding to Paraburkhleria mimosarum, Paraburkholderia phymatum, Paraburkholeria carbensis, Cupriavidus taiwanensis, Cupriavidus sp., Rhizobium altiplani, Rhizobium mesoamericanum, and Rhizobium etli. The majority of the isolates were Cupriavidus (62.6%), followed by Paraburkholderia (33.5%) and Rhizobium (2.9%). Cupriavidus strains were more predominant in nodules of M. diplotricha (76.2) than in M. pudica (59.9%), and the distribution of P. phymatum in those two plant species was reverse (3.4:18.2%). Four symbiotypes were defined among the isolates based upon the phylogeny of nodA-nifH genes, represented by P. mimosarum, P. phymatum-P. caribensis, Cupriavidus spp., and Rhizobium spp. The species affiliation and the symbiotype division among the isolates demonstrated the multiple origins of Mimosa rhizobia in China: most were similar to those found in the original centers of Mimosa plants, but Cupriavidus sp. might have a local origin. The unbalanced distribution of symbionts between the two Mimosa species might be related to the soil pH, organic matter and available nitrogen; Cupriavidus spp. generally dominated most of the soils colonized by Mimosa in this study, but it had a particular preference for neutral-alkaline soils with low fertility whereas. While Paraburkholderia spp. preferred more acidic and fertile soils.

We therefore investigated the diversity of rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria associated with the invasive annual plant Senecio vulgaris L. (Asteraceae) based on 16S rRNA gene data obtained from 57 samples of four Senecio vulgaris populations in a subtropical mountainous area in central China. Significant differences in diversity were observed between plant compartments. Specifically, the rhizosphere harbored many more bacterial operational taxonomic units and showed higher alpha diversity than the leaf and root endospheres. The relative abundance profiles of the bacterial community composition differed substantially between the compartments and populations, especially at the phylum and family levels. However, the top five phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria) accounted for more than 90% of all the bacterial communities. Moreover, similar endophytic communities with a shared core set of bacteria were observed from different Senecio vulgaris populations. Heavy-metal-resistant, phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Brevundimonas diminuta), nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium leguminosarum), and cold-resistant bacteria (Exiguobacterium sibiricum) were present in the endosphere at relatively high abundance.

One useful approach is to examine congeners varying in invasiveness in a comparative framework across native and invaded ranges. Acacia species have been widely introduced outside their native range of Australia, and a subset of these species have become invasive in multiple parts of the world. Within specific regions, the invasive status of these species varies. Our study examined whether a key mechanism in the life history of Acacia species, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, influences acacia invasiveness on a regional scale. To assess the extent to which species varying in invasiveness correspondingly differ with regard to the diversity of rhizobia they associate with, we grew seven Acacia species ranging in invasiveness in California in multiple soils from both their native (Australia) and introduced (California) ranges. In particular, the aim was to determine whether more invasive species formed symbioses with a wider diversity of rhizobial strains (i.e. are more promiscuous hosts). We measured and compared plant performance, including aboveground biomass, survival, and nodulation response, as well as rhizobial community composition and richness. Host promiscuity did not differ among invasiveness categories. Acacia species that varied in invasiveness differed in aboveground biomass for only one soil and did not differ in survival or nodulation within individual soils. In addition, acacias did not differ in rhizobial richness among invasiveness categories. However, nodulation differed between regions and was generally higher in the native than introduced range. Our results suggest that all Acacia species introduced to California are promiscuous hosts and that host promiscuity per se does not explain the observed differences in invasiveness within this region. Our study also highlights the utility of assessing potential mechanisms of invasion in species' native and introduced ranges.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","0","0","0","6","0","8",NA,NA,"2041-2851","",NA,"MEDLINE:27535176","27535176",NA

Legume plants, such as Vachellia nilotica and alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala, are a major component of the vegetation there. Vachellia nilotica can establish in drought-prone environments, and is invasive in high rainfall areas. Leucaena leucocephala is an emerging invasive in South Africa and is ranked among the world's 100 most invasive alien species. Alien plants can invade native habitats through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and displace native vegetation. We investigated the effects of phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity on legume-microbe symbiosis, nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) growth costs of these two legumes in grassland soils. We used as inoculum and growth substrate soils collected from a long-term (>65 years) nutrient and lime-addition trial, the Veld Fertilizer Trial (VFT), located at Ukulinga Research Farm near Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. We used soils from three VFT treatments: soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year (+P), soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year with dolomitic lime (2250 kg ha-1) applied once every 5 years (P+L) and soils with no superphosphate and no dolomitic lime applications (Control). Seeds of V. nilotica and L. leucocephala were germinated and grown independently in these soils in green house conditions and harvested after 125 days for measurement of growth, legume-microbe symbiosis, N nutrition and C growth costs. Results showed that the two legumes had different growth adaptations. Vachellia nilotica grown in control soils and +P soils nodulated with various Burkholderia spp., while L. leucocephala did not nodulate in all soil treatments. Both legumes utilized for growth both atmospheric- and soil-derived N across all treatments thereby decreasing C growth costs. Vachellia nilotica grown in +P soils accumulated the most biomass and N nutrition. Leucaena leucocephala maximized specific N assimilation rates by investing in below-ground biomass accumulation in control soils. This shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass and relying on utilization of N from both the soil and the atmosphere.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"2041-2851","",NA,"MEDLINE:35747246","35747246",NA

Ten isolates with relatively high PGP activities were identified to belong to the genera Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas and Ralstonia. The numerical classification based on bacterial resistant characteristics was mostly consistent with their phylogenetic positions.

Compared with non-inoculated plants, strains S6-1 and S2-3 significantly increased the height, dry weight and N uptake of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). The presence of S6-1 significantly increased Pb accumulation and enhanced the translocation of Zn from root to shoot in sorghum. Strain S2-3 helped sorghum to uptake Cu and Zn and improved the remediation effect of sorghum on Cu and Zn.

Almost 60% of this grassy field has been invaded by the exotic molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora), which constitutes a severe threat to the biodiversity and survival of this biome, particularly due to the impacts of annual fires and inappropriate restoration interventions. Many invasive species exhibit a high demand for nitrogen (N). Hence, this work aimed to study the N cycle alterations promoted by M. minutiflora in a site of the campo rupestre, where the leguminous species Mimosa pogocephala was prevalent. The biome's soils exhibited a high natural N fertility and low C:N ratio. The main N source in this biome resulted from the biological N fixation performed by M. pogocephala associated with Burkholderia nodosa, as evidenced by the total leaf N content, leaf delta15N signature, nodule occupation and bacterial molecular identification analyses. The displacement of native species by molasses grass was associated with changes in the soil N forms, namely the nitrate increased as the ammonium decreased. The latter was the dominant N form in the native species plots, as observed in the soil analysis of total N, ammonium and nitrate contents. The dominant ammonium form was changed to the nitric form by the stimulation of ammonia-oxidising bacteria populations due to the invasive species. Therefore, the key mechanism behind the invasiveness of the exotic grass and the concomitant displacement of the native species may be associated with changes in the soil N chemical species. Based on this finding and on the high N-based soil fertility found in the campo rupestre N fertilisation procedures for restoration of invaded areas should be strictly avoided in this biome.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13","1","0","0","11","2","14",NA,NA,"","1879-1026",NA,"MEDLINE:27823824","27823824",NA

Using phylogenetic and ecological interaction network approaches we provide the first report of the structure of belowground legume-rhizobium interaction networks and how they change along a gradient of invasion (uninvaded, semi invaded and heavily invaded sites) by Australian Acacia species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We found that native and invasive legumes interact with distinct rhizobial lineages, most likely due to phylogenetic uniqueness of native and invasive host plants. Moreover, legume-rhizobium interaction networks are not nested, but significantly modular with high levels of specialization possibly as a result of legume-rhizobium co-evolution. Although network topology remained constant across the invasion gradient, composition of bacterial communities associated with native legumes changed dramatically as acacias increasingly dominated the landscape. In stark contrast to aboveground interaction networks (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal) we show that invasive legumes do not infiltrate existing native legume-rhizobium networks but rather form novel modules. This absence of mutualist overlap between native and invasive legumes suggests the importance of co-invading rhizobium-acacia species complexes for Acacia invasion success, and argues against a ubiquitous role for the formation and evolutionary refinement of novel interactions.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"26","0","0","0","26","0","26",NA,NA,"2041-2851","",NA,"MEDLINE:27255514","27255514",NA

These novel strains of bacteria were mostly isolated from the root nodules of indigenous and invasive legumes belonging to the sub families Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae in South Africa, South America and South East China. These rhizobia are phylogenetically and taxonomically different from the traditional 'alpha rhizobia' and are termed 'beta-rhizobia' as they belong to the beta-sub class of Proteobacteria. There are also new reports of novel species of root nodulating bacteria from the alpha-Proteobacteria, not known for several decades since the discovery of rhizobia. However, in this review focus is given to the emerging beta-rhizobia isolated from the indigenous Papilionoid legumes in the Cape Floristic regions in South Africa and the indigenous and invasive Mimosoid legumes in South America and South East Asia respectively. The nodulation of the indigenous South African Papilionoid legumes including that of Aspalathus linearis (rooibos) is discussed in a bit detail. Previous reports indicated that A. linearis is very specific in its rhizobium requirement and was reported to be nodulated by the slow growing Bradyrhizobium spp. This review however summarizes that the bacteria associated with the root nodules of A. linearis belong to members of both the alpha (alpha) Proteobacteria that include Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp. and the beta (beta) Proteobacteria represented by the genus Burkholderia (now reclassified as Paraburkholderia). In addition, the occurrence of Paraburkholderia as the newly emerging root nodule symbionts of various other legumes has been discussed. In doing so, the review highlights that nodulation is no longer restricted to the traditional 'rhizobia' group following the emergence of the new beta rhizobia as potential nodulators of various indigenous legumes. It thus provides some insights on the status of the legume-rhizobium host specificity concept and the loss of this specificity in several symbiotic associations that puts the long held dogma of host specificity of the legume rhizobium symbiosis in a dilemma.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","3","0","4",NA,NA,"","1573-0972",NA,"MEDLINE:32095903","32095903",NA

Using DNA from 348 wild pigs and sera from 320 individuals at 24 sites, we employed population genetic techniques to infer individual dispersal, and an Akaike information criterion framework to compare candidate logistic regression models that incorporated both dispersal and land cover composition. Our findings suggested that recent dispersal conferred higher odds of exposure to PrV, but not Brucella spp., among wild pigs throughout the Kissimmee Valley region. Odds of exposure also increased in association with agriculture and open canopy pine, prairie, and scrub habitats, likely because of highly localized resources within those land cover types. Because the effect of open canopy on PrV exposure reversed when agricultural cover was available, we suggest that small-scale resource distribution may be more important than overall resource abundance.

This should provide defense against the cytosol-invasive Burkholderia and Shigella species by lysing the infected cell via pyroptosis. However, recent evidence has shown caspase-11 and gasdermin D activation can result in two different outcomes: pyroptosis and autophagy. Burkholderia cepacia complex has the ability invade the cytosol but is unable to inhibit caspase-11 and gasdermin D. Yet instead of activating pyroptosis during infection with these bacteria, the autophagy pathway is stimulated through caspases and gasdermin D. In contrast, Burkholderia thailandensis can invade the cytosol where caspasae-11 and gasdermin D is activated but the result is pyroptosis of the infected cell. In this review we propose a hypothetical model to explain why autophagy would be the solution to kill one type of Burkholderia species, but another Burkholderia species is killed by pyroptosis. For pathogens with high virulence, pyroptosis is the only solution to kill bacteria. This explains why some pathogens, such as Shigella have evolved methods to inhibit caspase-11 and gasdermin D as well as autophagy. We also discuss similar regulatory steps that affect caspase-1 that may permit the cell to forbear undergoing pyroptosis after caspase-1 activates in response to bacteria with partially effective virulence factors.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"","1664-3224",NA,"MEDLINE:35422805","35422805",NA

The ability to take advantage of novel mutualists or survive and reproduce despite a lack of mutualists may facilitate invasion by those individuals with such traits. Here, we used two greenhouse studies to examine how soil microbial communities in general and mutualistic rhizobia in particular affect the performance of a legume species (Medicago polymorpha) that has invaded five continents. We performed two plant growth experiments with Medicago polymorpha, inoculating them with soil slurries in one experiment or rhizobial cultures in another experiment. For both experiments, we compared the growth of Medicago in competition with conspecific or heterospecific plants and examined variation among plant genotypes collected from the native and introduced ranges. We found that all genotypes experienced similar increases in biomass and formed more nodules that house rhizobia bacteria when inoculated with soil from a previously invaded site, compared to uninoculated plants or plants inoculated with soil from uninvaded and low invasion sites. In a second experiment, plants inoculated with rhizobia generally produced more biomass, had greater tolerance to interspecific competition, and had greater effects on competitor biomass than uninoculated plants. However, plant genotypes collected from the native range benefited more from rhizobia and were less tolerant of competition relative to genotypes collected from the introduced range. In the introduced range, compatible mutualists may not be readily available but competition is intense, causing Medicago to evolve to benefit less from interactions with rhizobia mutualists, while simultaneously becoming more tolerant of competition.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7","0","0","0","6","0","7",NA,NA,"","1432-1939",NA,"MEDLINE:29943143","29943143",NA

Combinations of 4HB carbon precursors consisting of 1,6-hexanediol and gamma-butyrolactone were applied for the production of P(3HB-co-4HB) with different 4HB molar fraction.

To understand variation at different spatial scales, from individual legumes in the fynbos (South Africa) to a global context, we analyzed chromosomal (16S rRNA, recA) and symbiosis (nifH, nodA, nodC) gene sequences. We showed that the global diversity of nodulation genes is generally grouped according to the South African papilionoid or South American mimosoid subfamilies, whereas chromosomal sequence data were unrelated to biogeography. While nodulation genes are structured on a continental scale, a geographic or host-specific distribution pattern was not detected in the fynbos region. In host range experiments, symbiotic promiscuity of Burkholderia tuberum STM678(T) and B phymatum STM815(T) was discovered in selected fynbos species. Finally, a greenhouse experiment was undertaken to assess the ability of mimosoid (Mimosa pudica) and papilionoid (Dipogon lignosus, Indigofera filifolia, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Podalyria calyptrata) species to nodulate in South African (fynbos) and Malawian (savanna) soils. While the Burkholderia-philous fynbos legumes (D lignosus, I filifolia, and P calyptrata) nodulated only in their native soils, the invasive neotropical species M pudica did not develop nodules in the African soils. The fynbos soil, notably rich in Burkholderia, seems to retain nodulation genes compatible with the local papilionoid legume flora but is incapable of nodulating mimosoid legumes that have their center of diversity in South America.IMPORTANCE: This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic assessment of root-nodulating Burkholderia and investigated biogeographic and host-related patterns of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis in the South African fynbos biome, as well as at global scales, including native species from the South American Caatinga and Cerrado biomes.

Here, we investigate HILIC enrichment-independent approaches for the study of bacterial glycoproteomes. Using three Burkholderia species (Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia Dolosa, and Burkholderia ubonensis), we demonstrate that short aliphatic O-linked glycopeptides are typically absent from HILIC enrichments, yet are readily identified in whole proteome samples. Using high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) fractionation, we show that at high compensation voltages (CVs), short aliphatic glycopeptides can be enriched from complex samples, providing an alternative means to identify glycopeptide recalcitrant to hydrophilic-based enrichment. Combining whole proteome and FAIMS analyses, we show that the observable glycoproteome of these Burkholderia species is at least 25% larger than what was initially thought. Excitingly, the ability to enrich glycopeptides using FAIMS appears generally applicable, with the N-linked glycopeptides of Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus also being enrichable at high FAIMS CVs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FAIMS provides an alternative means to access glycopeptides and is a valuable tool for glycoproteomic analysis.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22","0","0","0","17","0","21",NA,NA,"","1535-3907",NA,"MEDLINE:33125241","33125241",NA

Previous studies revealed that bacteria contain many promiscuous enzymes causing a so-called 'underground metabolism', which can be important for the evolution of novel pathways. Here, we evaluated the potential of B. subtilis to use a truncated non-native DXP-dependent PLP pathway from E. coli for PLP synthesis. Adaptive laboratory evolution experiments revealed that two non-native enzymes catalysing the last steps of the DXP-dependent PLP pathway and two genomic alterations are sufficient to allow growth of vitamin B6 auxotrophic bacteria as rapid as the wild type. Thus, the existence of an underground metabolism in B. subtilis facilitates the generation of a pathway for synthesis of PLP using parts of a non-native vitamin B6 pathway.

For example, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is thought to represent one of the major centres of diversity for the rhizobial members of Burkholderia, yet only five species have been described from legumes occurring in this region and numerous are still awaiting taxonomic treatment. Here, we investigated the taxonomic status of 12 South African root-nodulating Burkholderia isolates from native papilionoid legumes (Hypocalyptus coluteoides, H. oxalidifolius, H. sophoroides and Virgilia oroboides). Analysis of four gene regions (16S rRNA, recA, atpD and rpoB) revealed that the isolates represent a genealogically unique and exclusive assemblage within the genus. Its distinctness was supported by all other aspects of the polyphasic approach utilized, including the genome-based criteria DNA-DNA hybridization (≥70.9%) and average nucleotide identities (≥96%).

The effects of Burkholderia sp. Y4 on rice growth, oxidative damage caused by Cd, and Cd accumulation were studied. Additionally, the Cd2+ flux rates in the elongation zone of rice roots under Burkholderia sp. Y4 application were detected using non-invasive micro-test technology. Burkholderia sp. Y4 alleviated the inhibition effect of Cd on rice seed germination by 13.8%. After inoculation with Burkholderia sp. Y4 for 7 d, the length of rice roots and buds increased by 83.3% and 12.2%, and their dry weight increased by 56.8% and 12.5%, respectively; those in the 10 d Y4 inoculation group increased by 28.6% and 20.0% in length and by 113.2% and 46.0% in dry weight, respectively. Burkholderia sp. Y4 inoculation also alleviated rice oxidative stress damage caused by Cd. The application of strain Y4 significantly reduced the content of the oxidative damage product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings by 21.5% and 16.9%, respectively. Under Burkholderia sp. Y4 inoculation, the significant changes in antioxidant enzyme SOD and CAT activities caused by Cd stress disappeared in rice roots; those in shoots also decreased from 176.9% and 74.8% to 53.3% and 21.5%, respectively. Conversely, Burkholderia sp. Y4 inhibited Cd uptake by rice seedlings with different genotypes, including the low Cd-accumulation variety X24 and high Cd-accumulation variety T705. The root application of strain Y4 significantly reduced Cd accumulation in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings by 79.2% and 62.7% in T705 and by 57.3% and 24.1% in X24, respectively. The Cd2+ flux rate of high Cd-accumulation variety T705 was significantly higher than that of low Cd-accumulation variety X24. Under Burkholderia sp. Y4 inoculation, the yellow membrane was formed on the root surface of rice seedlings, and the Cd2+ flux rate in the elongation zone of T705 and X24 roots decreased by 36.0% and 35.0% in 3-day-old seedlings, as well as by 44.6% and 24.9% in 10-day-old seedlings, respectively. In conclusion, Burkholderia sp. Y4 inoculation inhibited the toxic effects of Cd on rice seedling growth through alleviating oxidative stress and damage caused by Cd. Furthermore, the root application of Burkholderia sp.

This study aimed at answering these questions by using 14C-chlorpyrifos (14C-CPF) and two CPF-degrading strains (Pseudomonas sp. DSP-1 and Cupriavidus sp. P2). The results showed that the BRs can be up to 83.0%, and that the CPF-BRs formed can be further transformed into 14CO2 by the strains. Indeed, the microbial inoculation can increase the CPF mineralization by 1.0-22.1 times and can decrease the BRs by up to ~50% of the control (on day 20). Compared with the control without bioaugmentation, microbial inoculation enhanced the release of BRs by 2.2-18.0 times. Adding biochar to the soil can greatly inhibit CPF mineralization and maintain the BR content at a relatively stable level. The CPF residue can affect the composition of the indigenous soil microbial community, but the introduction of bacteria for remediation did not have a significant effect. The results indicate that Pseudomonas sp. DSP-1 and Cupriavidus sp.

The products of this specialized secretion system are particularly important for the B. pseudomallei infection. Lacking in one or more components of the TTSS demonstrated different degrees of defects in the intracellular lifecycle of B. pseudomallei. Further understanding the functional roles of proteins involved in B. pseudomallei TTSS will enable us to dissect the enigma of B. pseudomallei-host cell interaction. In this study, BipC (a translocator), which was previously reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei, was further characterized using the bioinformatics and molecular approaches. The bipCgene, coding for a putative invasive protein, was first PCR amplified from B. pseudomallei K96243 genomic DNA and cloned into an expression vector for overexpression in Escherichia coli. The soluble protein was subsequently purified and assayed for actin polymerization and depolymerization. BipC was verified to subvert the host actin dynamics as demonstrated by the capability to polymerize actin in vitro. Homology modeling was also attempted to predict the structure of BipC.

Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacteria, currently consisting of 23 closely related species, and Burkholderia gladioli, can cause serious and difficult-to-treat infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Identifying Burkholderia bacteria to the species level is considered important for understanding epidemiology and infection control, and predicting clinical outcomes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF) is a rapid method recently introduced in clinical laboratories for bacterial species-level identification. However, reports on the ability of MALDI-TOF to accurately identify Bcc to the species level are mixed.Aim. The aim of this project was to evaluate the accuracy of MALDI-TOF using the Biotyper and VITEK MS systems in identifying isolates from 22 different Bcc species and B. gladioli compared to recA gene sequencing, which is considered the current gold standard for Bcc.Methodology. To capture maximum intra-species variation, phylogenetic trees were constructed from concatenated multi-locus sequence typing alleles and clustered with a novel k-medoids approach. One hundred isolates representing 22 Bcc species, plus B. gladioli, were assessed for bacterial identifications using the two MALDI-TOF systems.Results. At the genus level, 100 and 97.0 % of isolates were confidently identified as Burkholderia by the Biotyper and VITEK MS systems, respectively; moreover, 26.0 and 67.0 % of the isolates were correctly identified to the species level, respectively. In many, but not all, cases of species misidentification or failed identification, a representative library for that species was lacking.Conclusion. Currently available MALDI-TOF systems frequently do not accurately identify Bcc bacteria to the species level.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5","1","0","0","5","1","6",NA,NA,"","1473-5644",NA,"MEDLINE:32597748","32597748",NA

However, the rocks also introduced multiple new stresses via chemical changes associated with pH, elemental leaching and surface adsorption of nutrients that were reflected in the proteome. For example, the loss of bioavailable phosphorus was observed and resulted in the upregulation of diverse phosphate limitation proteins, which facilitate increase phosphate uptake and scavenging within the cell.

An insertion mutant of the Bp bfmR gene resulted in a significant decrease in expression of fimbriae chaperone-usher assembly genes (BPSL2O28 and BPSL22 7), leading to suppression of assembly of fimbriae on the cell surface and reduced biofilm formation.

In addition, the bfmR mutant strain showed retarded growth in low-iron medium and in phagocytic cells compared to the wild-type strain.

In the greenhouse experiment, R. sativus soils had a net positive effect on L. nanus biomass.

One of the major threats arising from continually growing and expanding populations is their relevant role in maintaining and transmitting various vector-borne pathogens among wildlife, domestic animals and humans. According to the WHO, over 17% of infectious diseases are vector-borne diseases, including those transmitted by ticks. Every year tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) create new public health challenges. Some of the emerging diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and rickettsiosis, have been described in recent years as posing important threats to global health. In this review we summarize current molecular and serological data on the occurrence, diversity and prevalence of some of the TBPs, namely Babesia, Theileria, Hepatozoon, Borrelia, Rickettsia, Bartonella, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia, that have been detected in raccoons and raccoon dogs that inhabit their native habitats and introduced areas. We draw attention to the limited data currently available on these invasive carnivores as potential reservoirs of TBPs in different parts of the world.

Today, glanders infections in humans are rare, likely due to less frequent contact with infected equids than in the past. Acutely ill humans often have non-specific clinical signs and in order to diagnose cases, especially in scenarios of multiple cases in an unexpected setting, rapid diagnostics for B. mallei may be critical. The pathogenesis of acute glanders in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) was studied as an initial effort to improve diagnostic methods. In the study described here, the diagnostic techniques of PCR, culture and histopathology were compared. The results indicated that PCR may provide rapid, non-invasive diagnosis of glanders in some cases. As expected, PCR results were positive in lung tissue in 11/12 acutely infected rhesus macaques, but more importantly in terms of diagnostic algorithm development, PCR results were frequently positive in non-invasive samples such as broncho-alveolar lavage or nasal swabs (7/12) and occasionally in blood (3/12). However, conventional bacterial culture failed to recover bacteria in many of these samples. The study showed that the clinical presentation of aerosol-exposed rhesus macaques is similar to descriptions of human glanders and that PCR has potential for rapid diagnosis of outbreaks, if not individual cases.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3","0","0","0","3","0","3",NA,NA,"","1473-5644",NA,"MEDLINE:25850696","25850696",NA

We recently used yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening to identify a small set of novel Burkholderia proteins that were shown to attenuate disease progression in an aerosol infection animal model using the virulent Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 strain. Here, we performed an extended analysis of primarily nine B. mallei virulence factors and their interactions with human proteins to map out how the bacteria can influence and alter host processes and pathways. Specifically, we employed topological analyses to assess the connectivity patterns of targeted host proteins, identify modules of pathogen-interacting host proteins linked to processes promoting infectivity, and evaluate the effect of crosstalk among the identified host protein modules. Overall, our analysis showed that the targeted host proteins generally had a large number of interacting partners and interacted with other host proteins that were also targeted by B. mallei proteins. We also introduced a novel Host-Pathogen Interaction Alignment (HPIA) algorithm and used it to explore similarities between host-pathogen interactions of B. mallei, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica. We inferred putative roles of B. mallei proteins based on the roles of their aligned Y. pestis and S. enterica partners and showed that up to 73% of the predicted roles matched existing annotations. A key insight into Burkholderia pathogenicity derived from these analyses of Y2H host-pathogen interactions is the identification of eukaryotic-specific targeted cellular mechanisms, including the ubiquitination degradation system and the use of the focal adhesion pathway as a fulcrum for transmitting mechanical forces and regulatory signals. This provides the mechanisms to modulate and adapt the host-cell environment for the successful establishment of host infections and intracellular spread.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22","1","0","0","20","0","23",NA,NA,"","1553-7358",NA,"MEDLINE:25738731","25738731",NA

Three pairs of primers were used to find the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) synthase class and sequence. The synthesized polymers were composed by short-chain length PHA (scl-PHA), especially polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and medium chain length PHA (mcl-PHA), especially polyhydroxydodecanoate (PHDd), and their concentration, constitution and molecular weight depend on carbon source used. The bacterium showed only class I synthase which could not explain the mcl-PHA production.CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia contaminans has a class I PHA synthase and produces PHB combined to PHDd when cultivated in sucrose or glucose, and PHDd concentration is affected when casein is used.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PHA are natural polymers produced by a wide range of bacteria. The presence of PHDd monomers confers to the polymer elastomeric properties. Previously, PHDd was only obtained when bacteria were cultivated in related carbon source.

We investigated the structure and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiomes of native annual forbs and invasive annual grasses grown in a shade-house both individually and in competition using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region. We assessed how differentially abundant microbial families correlate to plant biomass under competition. We find that bacterial diversity and structure differ between native forbs and invasive grasses, but fungal diversity and structure do not. Furthermore, bacterial community structures under competition are distinct from individual bacterial community structures.

Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, in endemic areas, poses a challenge for treating the diseased populations without accurate diagnosis, and the disease-specific biomarkers linked with the infection have yet to be reported. Due to the invasive nature of the causative agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, host innate effector mechanisms, including autophagy are known to be activated, resulting in differential expression of cellular proteins and immune markers. Identification of a disease-specific biomarker associated with B. pseudomallei infection will be helpful to facilitate rapid confirmation of melioidosis, which would enable early treatment and therapeutic success.Aim. We aimed to assess the levels of a host autophagy component, p62/NBR1, which function as a cargo-receptor in the process of autophagy activation leading to the degradation of ubiquitin-coated intracellular bacteria in which p62/NBR1 itself is degraded in the clearance of the pathogen. We further probed the extent of intracellular p62/NBR1 degradation and assessed its potential as a melioidosis biomarker.Methodology. We analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates using an ELISA-based assay for detecting cytosolic autophagy-related proteins p62/NBR1. We measured p62/NBR1 levels in diseased (confirmed B. pseudomallei infection) and non -diseased populations and utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and max Youden index analysis for evaluating potential disease biomarker characteristics.Results. Our results revealed a three to fivefold increase in p62/NBR1 levels confirmed melioidosis cases compared to uninfected healthy donors. Comparable to p62/NBR1, levels of cytosolic LC3-I levels also increased, whereas the levels of degraded membrane bound form LC3-II was low, suggesting autophagy deficiency. Proinflammatory serum cytokine response, particularly IL-6, was consistently higher alongside B. pseudomallei infection in comparison to healthy controls.Conclusions. ROC curve and max Youden index analysis suggest that increased p62/NBR1 levels in diseased populations display characteristics of a potential disease biomarker in melioidosis and illustrates that an elevated p62/NBR1 level, in conjunction with B. pseudomallei infection associated with autophagy deficiency.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","1","0","1",NA,NA,"","1473-5644",NA,"MEDLINE:32815800","32815800",NA

For 105 plant species or subspecies, over a total of 290 valid taxonomical descriptions of bacteria belonging to either one or more of these three categories were found, yielding 85 taxa of symbionts, 142 taxa of endophytes in nodules, and 33 in other plant parts. The most frequent cases were within the Medicago, Trifolium, Lotus, Phaseolus, and Vicia genera, the majority of symbionts belonged to the Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Sinorhizobium taxa. Both nodular and extra-nodular endophytes were highly represented by Gammaproteobacteria (Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Pantoea) and Firmicutes (Bacillus, Paenibacillus), along with a surprisingly high diversity of the Actinobacteria genus Micromonospora. The most plant-promiscuous bacteria were Sinorhizobium meliloti as symbiont and Bacillus megaterium as endophyte. In addition to the microbial analyses we introduce a practical user-friendly software tool for plant taxonomy determination working in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that we have purposely elaborated for the classification of legume species of Sardinia.

We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the Bp1651 genome and analyzed the sequence using comparative genomic analyses with susceptible strains, keyword searches of the annotation, publicly available antimicrobial resistance prediction tools, and published reports. More than 100 genes in the Bp1651 sequence were identified as potentially contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Most notably, we identified three previously uncharacterized point mutations in penA, which codes for a class A beta-lactamase and was previously implicated in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The mutations result in amino acid changes T147A, D240G, and V261I. When individually introduced into select agent-excluded B. pseudomallei strain Bp82, D240G was found to contribute to ceftazidime resistance and T147A contributed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and imipenem resistance. This study provides the first evidence that mutations in penA may alter susceptibility to carbapenems in B. pseudomallei Another mutation of interest was a point mutation affecting the dihydrofolate reductase gene folA, which likely explains the trimethoprim resistance of this strain. Bp1651 was susceptible to aminoglycosides likely because of a frameshift in the amrB gene, the transporter subunit of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump.

Like other clinically important Gram-negative bacteria, fundamental to B. pseudomallei pathogenesis is the Bsa Type III Secretion System. The Bsa system injects bacterial effector proteins into the cytoplasm of target host cells subverting cellular pathways for the benefit of the bacteria. It is required for invasion of non-phagocytic host cells, escape from the endocytic compartment into the host cell cytoplasm, and for virulence in murine models of melioidosis. We have recently described the repertoire of effector proteins secreted by the B. pseudomallei Bsa system, however the functions of many of these effector proteins remain an enigma. One such protein is BipC, a homolog of the translocator/effector proteins SipC and IpaC from Salmonella spp. and Shigella flexneri respectively. SipC and IpaC each have separate and distinct roles acting both as translocators, involved in creating a pore in the eukaryotic cell membrane through which effector proteins can transit, and as effectors by interacting with and polymerizing host cell actin. In this study, pull-down assays demonstrate an interaction between BipC and actin. Furthermore, we show that BipC directly interacts with actin, preferentially with actin polymers (F-actin) and has the ability to polymerize actin in a similar manner as that described for SipC. Yet unlike SipC, BipC does not stabilize F-actin filaments, indicating a functionally distinct interaction with actin. Expression of Myc-tagged BipC in HeLa cells induces the formation of pseudopodia similar to that seen for IpaC. This study explores the effector function of BipC and reveals that actin interaction is conserved within the BipC/SipC/IpaC family of translocator/effector proteins.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","3","0","4",NA,NA,"","2235-2988",NA,"MEDLINE:28770177","28770177",NA

A case-control study was conducted to enroll 53 CCA patients, 47 cholelithiasis patients, and 40 healthy controls. The feces samples and clinical information of participants were collected in the same period. The gut microbiota and its diversity of individuals were accessed with 16S rDNA sequencing, and the gut microbiota profile was evaluated according to microbiota diversity. Finally, four enriched genera in the CCA group (genera Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae_unclassified, Muribaculum, and Alistipes) and eight enriched genera in the cholelithiasis group (genera Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Agathobacter, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, Collinsella, Escherichia-Shigella) constitute an overall different microbial community composition (P = 0.001). The B-F-R genera model with better diagnostic value than carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was identified by random forest and Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) to distinguish CCA patients from healthy controls [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.973, 95% CI = 0.932-1.0]. Moreover, the correlative analysis found that genera Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia were positively correlated with body mass index (BMI). The significantly different microbiomes between cholelithiasis and CCA were found via principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and Venn diagram and LEfSe were utilized to identify four genera by comparing microbial compositions among patients with malignant obstructive jaundice (MOJ-Y) or not (MOJ-N).

This study investigated the different patterns of N use and growth costs by a native and an introduced leguminous shrubby species.

The resulting strain, termed PPT1 (DeltapirC-REphaAB), produced high amounts of PHB under continuous light as well under a day-night regime. When grown in nitrogen and phosphorus depleted medium, the cells produced up to 63% per CDW. Upon the addition of acetate, the content was further increased to 81% per CDW. The produced polymer consists of pure PHB, which is highly isotactic.CONCLUSION: The amounts of PHB achieved with PPT1 are the highest ever reported in any known cyanobacterium and demonstrate the potential of cyanobacteria for a sustainable, industrial production of PHB.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22","0","0","0","15","0","23",NA,NA,"","1475-2859",NA,"MEDLINE:33353555","33353555",NA

However, the mechanisms by which the rhizobial control of NO affects root nodule symbiosis in Lotus japonicus are unknown. Therefore, we herein investigated the effects of enhanced NO removal by Mesorhizobium loti on symbiosis with L. japonicus. The hmp gene, which in Sinorhizobium meliloti encodes a flavohemoglobin involved in NO detoxification, was introduced into M. loti to generate a transconjugant with enhanced NO removal. The symbiotic phenotype of the transconjugant with L. japonicus was examined. The transconjugant showed delayed infection and higher nitrogenase activity in mature nodules than the wild type, whereas nodule senescence was normal. This result is in contrast to previous findings showing that enhanced NO removal in L. japonicus by class 1 phytoglobin affected nodule senescence. To evaluate differences in NO detoxification between M. loti and L. japonicus, NO localization in nodules was investigated. The enhanced expression of class 1 phytoglobin in L. japonicus reduced the amount of NO not only in infected cells, but also in vascular bundles, whereas that of hmp in M. loti reduced the amount of NO in infected cells only. This difference suggests that NO detoxification by M. loti exerts different effects in symbiosis than that by L. japonicus.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"","1347-4405",NA,"MEDLINE:34470944","34470944",NA

Plant nurseries importing material from abroad may play an important role in the introduction and spread of diseases such as ash dieback and sudden oak death which are thought to have been introduced through trade. The economic, environmental and social costs associated with the spread of invasive pathogens become considerably larger as the incidence of the pathogen increases. To control the movement of pathogens across the plant trade network it is crucial to develop monitoring programmes at key points of the network such as plant nurseries. By detecting the introduction of invasive pathogens at low incidence, the control and eradication of an epidemic is more likely to be successful. Equally, knowing the likelihood of having sold infected plants once a disease has been detected in a nursery can help designing tracing plans to control the onward spread of the disease. Here, we develop an epidemiological model to detect and track the movement of an invasive plant pathogen into and from a plant nursery. Using statistical methods, we predict the epidemic incidence given that a detection of the pathogen has occurred for the first time, considering that the epidemic has an asymptomatic period between infection and symptom development. Equally, we calculate the probability of having sold at least one infected plant during the period previous to the first disease detection. This analysis can aid stakeholder decisions to determine, when the pathogen is first discovered in a nursery, the need of tracking the disease to other points in the plant trade network in order to control the epidemic. We apply our method to high profile recent introductions including ash dieback and sudden oak death in the UK and citrus canker and Huanglongbing disease in Florida. These results provide new insight for the design of monitoring strategies at key points of the trade network.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"17","0","0","0","13","0","17",NA,NA,"","1095-8541",NA,"MEDLINE:27477202","27477202",NA

In this study we used two approaches to predict virulence factors of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. B. pseudomallei is naturally antibiotic resistant and there are no clinically available melioidosis vaccines. To identify B. pseudomallei protein targets for drug discovery and vaccine development, we chose to search for substrates of the B. pseudomallei periplasmic disulfide bond forming protein A (DsbA). DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into extra-cytoplasmic proteins and is essential for virulence in many Gram-negative organism, including B. pseudomallei. The first approach to identify B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates was a large-scale genomic analysis of 511 unique B. pseudomallei disease-associated strains. This yielded 4,496 core gene products, of which we hypothesise 263 are DsbA substrates. Manual curation and database screening of the 263 mature proteins yielded 81 associated with disease pathogenesis or virulence. These were screened for structural homologues to predict potential B-cell epitopes. In the second approach, we searched the B. pseudomallei genome for homologues of the more than 90 known DsbA substrates in other bacteria. Using this approach, we identified 15 putative B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates, with two of these previously identified in the genomic approach, bringing the total number of putative DsbA virulence factor substrates to 94. The two putative B. pseudomallei virulence factors identified by both methods are homologues of PenI family beta-lactamase and a molecular chaperone. These two proteins could serve as high priority targets for future B. pseudomallei virulence factor characterization.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","1","0","1",NA,NA,"","1932-6203",NA,"MEDLINE:33216758","33216758",NA

Chronic intestinal inflammation develops against resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. We hypothesized that host intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) G can be used to identify bacteria involved in IBD pathogenesis.RESULTS: IgG-bound and -unbound microorganisms were collected from 32 pediatric terminal ileum aspirate washes during colonoscopy [non-IBD (n=10), Crohn disease (n=15), and ulcerative colitis (n=7)], and composition was assessed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. In vitro analysis of invasive capacity was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and gentamicin invasion assay; immune activation was measured by qPCR. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, IgG binding favored specific and unique mucosa-associated species in pediatric IBD patients. Burkholderia cepacia, Flavonifractor plautii, and Rumminococcus sp. demonstrated increased IgG binding, while Pseudomonas ST29 demonstrated reduced IgG binding, in IBD. In vitro validation confirmed that B. cepacia, F. plautii, and Rumminococcus display invasive potential while Pseudomonas protogens did not.CONCLUSION: Using IgG as a marker of pathobionts in larger patient cohorts to identify microbes and elucidate their role in IBD pathogenesis will potentially underpin new strategies to facilitate development of novel, targeted diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. Interestingly, this method can be used beyond the scope of this manuscript to evaluate altered gut pathobionts in a number of diseases associated with altered microbiota including arthritis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and carcinomas.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"32","0","0","0","24","0","33",NA,NA,"","2049-2618",NA,"MEDLINE:30606251","30606251",NA

The linear, six-carbon polyol galactitol is abundant in vascular plants and is metabolized in S. meliloti by the contribution of two loci SMb21372-SMb21377 and SMc01495-SMc01503 which are found on pSymB and the chromosome, respectively. The data suggest that several transport systems, including the chromosomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter smoEFGK, contribute to the uptake of galactitol, while the adjacent gene smoS encodes a protein for oxidation of galactitol into tagatose. Subsequently, genes SMb21374 and SMb21373, encode proteins that phosphorylate and epimerize tagatose into fructose-6-phosphate, which is further metabolized by the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Of note, it was found that SMb21373, which was annotated as a 1,6-bis-phospho-aldolase, is homologous to the E. coli gene gatZ, which is annotated as encoding the non-catalytic subunit of a tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase heterodimer. When either of these genes was introduced into an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain that carries a tagatose-6-phosphate epimerase mutation, they are capable of complementing the galactitol growth deficiency associated with this mutation, strongly suggesting that these genes are both epimerases. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein family (IPR012062) to which these enzymes belong, suggests that this misannotation is systemic throughout the family.

Microbial systems have proved extremely useful to test evolutionary theory and identify mechanisms maintaining cooperation. One of the most widely studied system is the secretion and sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores by Pseudomonas bacteria, with many insights gained from this system now being considered as hallmarks of bacterial cooperation. Here, we introduce siderophore secretion by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel parallel study system, and show that this system behaves differently. For ornibactin, the main siderophore of this species, we discovered a novel mechanism of how cheating can be prevented. Particularly, we found that secreted ornibactin cannot be exploited by ornibactin-defective mutants because ornibactin receptor and synthesis genes are co-expressed from the same operon, such that disruptive mutations in synthesis genes compromise receptor availability required for siderophore uptake and cheating. For pyochelin, the secondary siderophore of this species, we found that cheating was possible, but the relative success of cheaters was positive frequency-dependent, thus diametrically opposite to the Pseudomonas and other microbial systems. Altogether, our results highlight that expanding our repertoire of microbial study systems leads to new discoveries and suggest that there is an enormous diversity of social interactions out there in nature, and we might have only looked at the tip of the iceberg so far.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10","0","0","0","6","0","10",NA,NA,"","2056-3744",NA,"MEDLINE:31844554","31844554",NA

Metabolically active bacterial communities varied with solution chemistry and mineral type. Burkholderia were significantly enriched in the obsidian treatment compared to the biotite treatment and were the most effective isolates at solubilizing phosphorous or mobilizing iron, in all the treatments.

We found that biochar addition had little impact on the physiological parameters of tissue cultures of R.pseudostellaria but did significantly mediate microbial abundance in the rhizosphere soil of different consecutive monoculture years, leading to decreases in the abundance of pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum, Talaromyces helicus, and Kosakonia sacchari.

In summary, this study details the potential mechanisms responsible for the biochar-stimulated changes in the abundances and metabolism of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi, decreases in the contents of pathogens, and therefore improvements in the environmental conditions for plants growth.

Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the biologically most-important vitamer, serves as a cofactor for many enzymes, mainly active in amino acid metabolism. While microorganisms and plants are capable of synthesizing vitamin B6, other organisms have to ingest it. The vitamer pyridoxine, which is used as a dietary supplement for animals and humans is commercially produced by chemical processes. The development of potentially more cost-effective and more sustainable fermentation processes for pyridoxine production is of interest for the biotech industry. We describe the generation and characterization of a Bacillus subtilis pyridoxine production strain overexpressing five genes of a non-native deoxyxylulose 5'-phosphate-dependent vitamin B6 pathway. The genes, derived from Escherichia coli and Sinorhizobium meliloti, were assembled to two expression cassettes and introduced into the B. subtilis chromosome. in vivo complementation assays revealed that the enzymes of this pathway were functionally expressed and active. The resulting strain produced 14mg/l pyridoxine in a small-scale production assay. By optimizing the growth conditions and co-feeding of 4-hydroxy-threonine and deoxyxylulose the productivity was increased to 54mg/l. Although relative protein quantification revealed bottlenecks in the heterologous pathway that remain to be eliminated, the final strain provides a promising basis to further enhance the production of pyridoxine using B. subtilis.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"35","1","0","0","32","0","36",NA,NA,"","1096-7184",NA,"MEDLINE:24972371","24972371",NA

Sequence analyses of rrs and four housekeeping genes (recA, atpD, gyrB and glnII) assigned 30 isolates to four putative new lineages and a single strain to Sinorhizobium meliloti. Thirteen slow-growing isolates representing the most dominant IGS (intergenic spacer) profile clustered distinctly from known rhizobia species within Bradyrhizobium with the closest related species being Bradyrhizobium shewense and Bradyrhizobium niftali, which had 95.17% and 95.1% sequence identity, respectively.

The soil property and soil biogeochemical activity were measured in both bulk and rhizosphere soil under the aggressive weed A. adenophora and under adjacent native plants. The composition of bacterial communities was investigated using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Due to the polymicrobial nature of these infections, the identification of the particular bacterial species responsible is an essential step in diagnosis and treatment. Current diagnostic procedures are time-consuming, and can also be expensive, invasive and unpleasant in the absence of spontaneously expectorated sputum. The development of a rapid, non-invasive methodology capable of diagnosing and monitoring early bacterial infection is desired. Future visions of real-time, in situ diagnosis via exhaled breath testing rely on the differentiation of bacteria based on their volatile metabolites. The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to investigate whether a range of CF-associated bacterial species (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus milleri) could be differentiated based on their in vitro volatile metabolomic profiles. Headspace samples were collected using solid phase microextraction (SPME), analyzed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC*GC-TOFMS) and evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) in order to assess the multivariate structure of the data. Although it was not possible to effectively differentiate all six bacteria using this method, the results revealed that the presence of a particular pattern of VOCs (rather than a single VOC biomarker) is necessary for bacterial species identification. The particular pattern of VOCs was found to be dependent upon the bacterial growth phase (e.g. logarithmic versus stationary) and sample storage conditions (e.g. short-term versus long-term storage at-18 °C). Future studies of CF-associated bacteria and exhaled breath condensate will benefit from the approaches presented in this study and further facilitate the production of diagnostic tools for the early detection of bacterial lung infections.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"41","1","0","0","23","1","42",NA,NA,"","1752-7163",NA,"MEDLINE:27120170","27120170",NA

A unique alpha-helix (alpha4) that extends from the body of SPLUNC1 is required for the bacteriostatic, surfactant, and LPS binding activities of this protein. Indeed, we find that mutation of just four leucine residues within this helical motif to alanine is sufficient to significantly inhibit the fluid spreading abilities of SPLUNC1, as well as its bacteriostatic actions against Gram-negative pathogens Burkholderia cenocepacia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conformational flexibility in the body of SPLUNC1 is also involved in the bacteriostatic, surfactant, and LPS binding functions of the protein as revealed by disulfide mutants introduced into SPLUNC1. In addition, SPLUNC1 exerts antibiofilm effects against Gram-negative bacteria, although alpha4 is not involved in this activity. Interestingly, though, the introduction of surface electrostatic mutations away from alpha4 based on the unique dolphin SPLUNC1 sequence, and confirmed by crystal structure, is shown to impart antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus aureus, the first SPLUNC1-dependent effect against a Gram-positive bacterium reported to date.

To achieve these aims, soil samples were collected from 28 locations in seven biomes throughout South Africa, which were then used to grow V. karroo seedlings under nitrogen-free conditions. The resulting 88 bacterial isolates were identified to genus-level using 16S rRNA sequence analysis and to putative species-level using recA-based phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that the rhizobial isolates represented members of several genera of Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, and Rhizobium), as well as Paraburkholderia from the Betaproteobacteria. Our study therefore greatly increases the known number of Paraburkholderia isolates which can associate with this southern African mimosoid host. We also show for the first time that members of this genus can associate with legumes, not only in the Fynbos biome, but also in the Albany Thicket and Succulent Karoo biomes. Twenty-six putative species were delineated among the 88 isolates, many of which appeared to be new to Science with other likely being conspecific or closely related to E. alkalisoli, M. abyssinicae, M. shonense, and P. tropica. We encountered only a single isolate of Bradyrhizobium, which is in contrast to the dominant association of this genus with Australian Acacia. V. karroo also associates with diverse genera in the Grassland biome where it is quite invasive and involved in bush encroachment. Our findings therefore suggest that V. karroo is a promiscuous host capable of forming effective nodules with both alpha- and beta-rhizobia, which could be a driving force behind the ecological success of this tree species.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","0","0","0","2","0","2",NA,NA,"1664-302X","",NA,"MEDLINE:31214140","31214140",NA

Supplementation of glutamate or complex protein hydrolysate then becomes necessary, often in large quantities, to support the high cell density desired during itaconate fermentation and adds to the production cost. Here, we present an alternative approach to overcome the glutamate auxotrophy in itaconate producers by synthetically introducing the Weimberg pathway from Burkholderia xenovorans for 2-ketoglutarate biosynthesis. Because of its independence from natural carbohydrate assimilation pathways in Escherichia coli, the Weimberg pathway is able to provide 2-ketoglutarate using xylose without compromising the carbon flux toward itaconate. With xylose concentration carefully tuned to minimize excess 2-ketoglutarate flux in the stationary phase, the final strain accumulated 20g/L of itaconate in minimal medium from 18g/L of xylose and 45g/L of glycerol. Necessity of the recombinant Weimberg pathway for growth also allowed us to maintain multi-copy plasmids carrying in operon the itaconate-producing genes without addition of antibiotics. Use of the Weimberg pathway for growth restoration is applicable to other production systems with disrupted 2-ketoglutarate synthesis.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"","2214-0301",NA,"MEDLINE:34934621","34934621",NA

Main mode of transmission is via percutaneous inoculation. Pneumonia is the most common presentation in acute disease.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33year old previously healthy Sinhalese female with an occupational exposure to surface water in paddy fields, who was on postpartum day 6 following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery via an elective caesarian section. She presented with a 1day history of breathlessness, preceded by a brief episode of fever. She had occasional right side coarse crackles and pitting oedema of both lower limbs. Shortly after admission, she developed type one respiratory failure needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Initial chest x-ray revealed slight obliteration of right medial diaphragmatic border while echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram excluded a pulmonary embolism, but revealed bilateral multi-lobar consolidation. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis with renal abscesses. As initial cultures were inconclusive, melioidosis antibody levels were done due to high degree of suspicion, which was found to be positive with a titer of 1:2560. A diagnosis of melioidosis was made based on the suggestive clinical picture, exposure history and the highly positive antibody level. She developed left side focal seizures together with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was negative for cerebral abscesses but revealed extensive minute haemorrhagic foci throughout the cerebrum. Thus, the final diagnosis was acute melioidosis causing pneumonia and renal abscesses, complicated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and sepsis. She demonstrated dramatic response to high dose meropenem and co-trimoxazole along with plasmapheresis. Four weeks after treatment, the antibody titer came down to 1:320. Melioidosis antibody was absent in the baby.CONCLUSIONS: This case was challenging as it was an atypical presentation of melioidosis during postpartum leading to a diagnostic conundrum.

Rhamnolipids can be widely applied in many industries including petroleum, food, agriculture and bioremediation etc. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is still the most competent producer of rhamnolipids, but its pathogenicity may cause safety and health concerns during large-scale production and applications. Therefore, extensive studies have been carried out to explore safe and economical methods to produce rhamnolipids. Various metabolic engineering efforts have also been applied to either P. aeruginosa for improving its rhamnolipid production and diminishing its pathogenicity, or to other non-pathogenic strains by introducing the key genes for safe production of rhamnolipids. The three key enzymes for rhamnolipid biosynthesis, RhlA, RhlB and RhlC, are found almost exclusively in Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp., but have been successfully expressed in several non-pathogenic host bacteria to produce rhamnolipids in large scales. The composition of mono- and di-rhamnolipids can also be modified through altering the expression levels of RhlB and RhlC. In addition, cell-free rhamnolipid synthesis by using the key enzymes and precursors from non-pathogenic sources is thought to not only eliminate pathogenic effects and simplify the downstream purification processes, but also to circumvent the complexity of quorum sensing system that regulates rhamnolipid biosynthesis. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa can also be reduced or eliminated through in vivo or in vitro enzymatic degradation of the toxins such as pyocyanin during rhamnolipid production. The rhamnolipid production cost can also be significantly reduced if rhamnolipid purification step can be bypassed, such as utilizing the fermentation broth or the rhamnolipid-producing strains directly in the industrial applications of rhamnolipids.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"111","3","0","0","70","1","116",NA,NA,"","1475-2859",NA,"MEDLINE:28779757","28779757",NA

Previous studies on Brucella lysogeny indicated that active phages are rare in this genus. To gain insight into the presence and nature of prophages in Ochrobactrum, temperate phages were isolated from various species and characterized in detail. In silico analyses disclosed numerous prophages in published Ochrobactrum genomes. Induction experiments showed that Ochrobactrum prophages can be induced by various stress factors and that some strains released phage particles even under non-induced conditions. Sixty percent of lysates prepared from 125 strains revealed lytic activity. The host range and DNA similarities of 19 phages belonging to the families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, or Podoviridae were determined suggesting that they are highly diverse. Some phages showed relationship to the temperate Brucella inopinata phage BiPB01. The genomic sequences of the myovirus POA1180 (41,655 bp) and podovirus POI1126 (60,065 bp) were analyzed. Phage POA1180 is very similar to a prophage recently identified in a Brucella strain isolated from an exotic frog. The POA1180 genome contains genes which may confer resistance to chromate and the ability to take up sulfate. Phage POI1126 is related to podoviruses of Sinorhizobium meliloti (PCB5), Erwinia pyrifoliae (Pep14), and Burkholderia cenocepacia (BcepIL02) and almost identical to an unnamed plasmid of the Ochrobactrum intermedium strain LMG 3301. Further experiments revealed that the POI1126 prophage indeed replicates as an extrachromosomal element.

In this study, we show that an endophytic bacterium, Burkholderia gladioli HDXY-02, isolated from the medicinal plant Lycoris aurea, showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against plant and human fungal pathogens. An antifungal ability assay indicated that the bioactive component was produced from strain HDXY-02 having an extracellular secreted component with a molecular weight lower than 1,000 Da. In addition, we found that this new antifungal could be produced effectively by liquid fermentation of HDXY-02. Furthermore, the purified component contributing to the antifungal activity was identified to be toxoflavin, a yellow compound possessing a pyrimido[5,4-e][1,2,4]triazine ring. In vitro bioactivity studies demonstrated that purified toxoflavin from B. gladioli HDXY-02 cultures had a significant antifungal activity against the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, resulting in abolished germination of conidia.

This proposed strategy provides a facile method for preparing MOF-based composites under mild conditions, facilitating the applications of MOF in the fields of biocatalyst construction, biomolecule encapsulation, and drug delivery.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"56","5","0","0","19","0","57",NA,NA,"2198-3844","",NA,"MEDLINE:30937262","30937262",NA

The Comanche lacewing naturally occurs in Southern California, whereas C. rufilabris is currently one of only two commercially available green lacewing in the United States. These sister species can be separated by larval morphological traits, by differences in courtship songs, and possibly by three nuclear genes wingless, PepCK, ATPase, yet they are not distinguishable based on the mitochondrial barcode gene (COI).

We show that fertile and viable hybrid progeny could be readily obtained in interspecific crosses and backcrosses and, although there is a trend toward lower hybrid fitness, postzygotic isolation is overall weak and might not prevent loss of genetic identity under natural conditions.

Disease can impact reproduction of elk and cattle, but is seldom considered in wild ruminants when reproductive output declines. We surveyed serological exposure of elk to causative agents in a bovine abortion profile (i.e., agents of brucellosis, leptospirosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea, and neosporosis), as these diseases can negatively affect reproduction of cattle and elk, which frequently co-occur. We determined seroprevalence of exposure to these agents and used hierarchical logistic regression to model both pregnancy and lactation status (a surrogate for calf survival to weaning) as a function of population and exposure to disease causative agents. Tested elk populations were exposed to 2–4 of the agents except for Brucella abortus, which was not present. Pregnancy varied by population (P < 0.016) but not by exposure to any agent (P > 0.213). Proportion of females lactating in autumn did not vary among populations (P > 0.247) nor by exposure to any agent (P > 0.281). Exposure did not affect productivity of elk, despite exposure levels reflective of previous surveys throughout North America and low pregnancy and calf survival in some populations. Because all surveyed elk populations showed exposure to bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), IBR would be the most likely disease to be introduced with elk, although risk is low given high seroprevalence to BHV-1 among cattle in Mexico. Conversely, brucellosis is endemic in Mexico and can significantly impact productivity of elk. Thus, contracting brucellosis from cattle is the highest disease-related threat to elk introductions or translocation in Mexico.","Resumen: Una parte del éxito de las reintroducciones de ciervo wapití (C. elaphus) en México depende de las interacciones y posibles conflictos con el ganado doméstico. Algunos agentes patógenos pueden impactar la reproducción del wapití y al ganado, pero es raro que se considere para los rumiantes silvestres cuando existe un declive en la productividad de la población. Se investigó la exposición a enfermedades de los wapití utilizando un perfil de aborto bovino (e.g. Brucelosis, leptospirosis, rinotraqueitis infecciosa bovina, (RIB), diarrea viral bovina, e infección por Neospora sp.), ya que estas enfermedades pueden afectar negativamente a la reproducción de los bovinos y rumiantes silvestres, y el wapití y el ganado frecuentemente co-ocurren. Utilizamos una regresión logística jerárquica para modelar la proporción de preñez de las hembras en periodo de lactancia (un sustituto para la supervivencia de la cría al destete) como una función de la población y la exposición de las enfermedades reproductivas. Se hicieron pruebas a poblaciones de wapití y fueron expuestos a 2-4 de los agentes patógenos evaluados, excepto para la brucelosis, que no estaba presente. La preñez de las hembras osciló entre 0.73-0.96 y la proporción de supervivencia al pre-destete desde 0.40-0.67 entre poblaciones. La época de preñez varió por población en todos los contrastes (P <0,016), pero no por la exposición a cualquier enfermedad (P> 0,213). La proporción de hembras lactantes en otoño no varió entre las poblaciones (P> 0,247), ni por la exposición a cualquier patógeno (P> 0,281). La exposición a patógenos no afectó la productividad del wapití, a pesar de los niveles de exposición que reflejan previos estudios en Estados Unidos de Norteamérica y la baja preñez y la sobrevivencia de crías entre algunas poblaciones. Debido a su presencia en todas las poblaciones de wapití en Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, si los productores de ganado adyacentes a los sitios de introducción de wapití en México están viendo menos crías que las esperadas, es posible que quieran vigilar su ganado para IBR para ver si BHV-1 puede ser un posible factor contribuyente, ya que el patógeno está relacionado con la reproducción y es probable que esté presente en los wapití.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"2448-8445","",NA,"SCIELO:S0065-17372018000100102",NA,NA

The overall animal-level seroprevalence was 9.3%; 11.3% (95% CI: 9.4-13.5) in indigenous cattle and 2.8% (95% CI:1.4-5.6) in exotic cattle. Further, the overall herd level seroprevalence was 32.0%; 50.5% (95% CI: 40.9-59.9) in indigenous cattle and 4.2% (95% CI: 1.3-12.4) in exotic cattle.

Brucella seroprevalence was also observed to vary according to districts, with Mbarari district recording the highest (45.4%). It is evident from the study that Brucellosis is present in Mbarari, Mbeya and Momba districts of Mbeya Region. The findings of this study provide some baseline data that could contribute to the design and implementation of brucellosis control measures in the study areas.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13","0","0","0","9","1","13",NA,NA,"","1873-6254",NA,"MEDLINE:29191516","29191516",NA

Diabetes is best managed by tight glycemic control, as achieving near-normal glucose levels is key to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. Currently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been recognized as the ideal monitoring systems for glycemic control of diabetic patients. Briefly, a CGM system measures blood glucose levels in subcutaneous tissue by attaching a CGM sensor to the skin, allowing the users to make appropriate modifications to their medical interventions according to experience or empirically derived algorithms. The principles of the glucose sensing employed in the current commercially available CGM systems are mainly electrochemical, and employ the gold standard enzyme, glucose oxidase, as the glucose sensing molecule with the combination of hydrogen peroxide monitoring or with the combination of redox mediator harboring hydrogel. Recently, by employing an abiotic synthetic receptor harboring a fluorescent probe combined with a fluorescent detection system, a chronic CGM was commercialized. In addition, the development of less or non-invasive monitoring sensors targeting glucose in tears, sweat, saliva and urine have become of great interest although their clinical relevancy is still controversial. This review article introduces current and future technological aspects of CGM systems, the flagship technology in biosensor research, which was initiated, matured and is still growing in North America.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"35","0","0","0","5","1","35",NA,NA,"","1873-4235",NA,"MEDLINE:33775474","33775474",NA

In the last years, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been proposed as complementary to classical biotyping methods. MLVA may add important information to the classical epidemiological investigation techniques, to help in tracing back sources of infection in brucellosis outbreaks. Sardinia is an Italian region officially free from sheep and goats brucellosis since 1998. In 2011, Brucella melitensis biovar 1, a biotype not reported in Italy since 1995, was isolated in one flock in the region. The genotyping MLVA-16 showed that isolates belonged to a rare American lineage, confirming it was introduced from other countries.

We studied the gut structure using a stereo microscope and used high throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions to investigate gut microbiota in different developmental stages of S. noctilio, including larvae, adults, and larval frass. We used PICRUSt2 to predict the functional profiles. The larval gut was thin and thread-like from the oral cavity to the anus, carrying few xylem particles in the crop. Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia s.l were the dominant bacteria in the guts of larvae, adults, and frass, respectively. Even though Pseudomonas was the most abundant among all bacteria, Zoogloea, Ruminobacter, and Nitrosospira, which might be involved in degrading organic matter and fixing nitrogen occurred exclusively in the larval gut indicating their possible role in the growth and development of larvae in pine tree xylem. Fungal communities did not change significantly across different developmental stages or the frass. Amylostereum was dominant in the woodwasp's larval gut. Functional prediction of bacterial and fungal communities revealed that they may encod enzymes involved in degrading lignocellulose and fixing nitrogen.

The success of artificial enzyme design is strongly dependent on the nature of the sequences used. Hence, sequences must be selected from databases and curated libraries prepared to enable a successful design by FCD. In this study, we proposed a selection approach regarding several key residues as sequence motifs. We used l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (TDH) as a model to test the validity of this approach. In the classification, four residues (143, 174, 188, and 214) were used as key residues. We classified thousands of TDH homologous sequences into five groups containing hundreds of sequences. Utilizing sequences in the libraries, we designed five artificial TDHs by FCD. Among the five, we successfully expressed four in soluble form. Biochemical analysis of artificial TDHs indicated that their enzymatic properties vary; half of the maximum measured enzyme activity (t1/2) and activation energies were distributed from 53 to 65 °C and from 38 to 125 kJ/mol, respectively. The artificial TDHs had unique kinetic parameters, distinct from one another. Structural analysis indicates that consensus mutations are mainly introduced in the secondary or outer shell. The functional diversity of the artificial TDHs is due to the accumulation of mutations that affect their physicochemical properties. Taken together, our findings indicate that our proposed approach can help generate artificial enzymes with unique enzymatic properties.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7","0","0","0","6","0","7",NA,NA,"","1520-4995",NA,"MEDLINE:32945652","32945652",NA

The destructive and invasive Colorado potato beetle (CPB) poses a serious threat to potato production. In response to this need, selectable marker-free transgenic potato lines expressing cry3A were developed to control the damage and spread of CPB.RESULTS: We simultaneously introduced cry3A and npt II genes harboured in different plasmids into the potato genome using the Agrobacterium-mediated cotransformation method. Four selectable marker-free transgenic potato (CT) lines expressing cry3A were developed by self-crossing segregation and molecular analyses, including Southern blot, western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays. CT lines were used in a resistance bioassay against CPB in the laboratory and field. In the laboratory, CT lines exhibited high resistance to CPB, and 100% mortality of first-instar larvae occurred 6 days after infestation. In the field, untransformed plant leaves were almost entirely consumed, with an average of 155 larvae present per plant 25 days after inoculation. However, CT lines showed no damage symptoms, with approximately 2.5 larvae surviving per plant.CONCLUSION: We successfully eliminated SMGs from the transgenic potato lines expressing cry3A in order to decrease CPB damage, control the spread of this pest eastwards and alleviate the concern regarding the safe assessment of regulatory requirements. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13","0","0","0","9","1","13",NA,NA,"","1526-4998",NA,"MEDLINE:25820984","25820984",NA

The use of effective native rhizobia inoculants to promote nitrogen fixation could be beneficial in climbing bean production. In this study, we carried out greenhouse and field experiments to evaluate symbiotic efficiency, compare the effect of native rhizobia and commercial inoculant on nodulation, growth and yield parameters of mid-altitude climbing bean (MAC 13 and MAC 64) varieties. The greenhouse experiment included nine native rhizobia isolates, a consortium of native isolates, commercial inoculant Biofix, a mixture of native isolates + Biofix, nitrogen treated control and a non-inoculated control. In the field experiments, the treatments included the best effective native rhizobia isolate ELM3, a consortium of native isolates, a commercial inoculant Biofix, a mixture of native isolates + Biofix, and a non-inoculated control. Remarkably, four native rhizobia isolates ELM3, ELM4, ELM5, and ELM8 showed higher symbiotic efficiencies compared to the Biofix. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in symbiotic efficiency between the two climbing bean varieties. Field results demonstrated a significant improvement in nodule dry weight and seed yields of MAC 13 and MAC 64 climbing bean varieties upon rhizobia inoculation when compared to the non-inoculated controls. Inoculation with ELM3 isolate resulted to the highest seed yield of 4,397.75 kg ha-1, indicating 89% increase over non-inoculated control (2,334.81 kg ha-1) and 30% increase over Biofix (3,698.79 kg ha-1). Farm site significantly influenced nodule dry weight and seed yields. This study, therefore, revealed the potential of native rhizobia isolates to enhance delivery of agroecosystem services including nitrogen fixation and bean production. Further characterization and mapping of the native isolates will be imperative in development of effective and affordable commercial inoculants.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"52","0","0","0","34","4","55",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:28408912","28408912",NA

A combination of geochemical analyses, metagenomic sequencing, ex-situ microcosm setups, and statistical analyses were used to investigate the environment-microbe interactions. The microbial communities and metabolic potentials along the terrace were studied by focusing on the genes associated with important biogeochemical processes (i.e., C, N, S cycling and metal resistance). Results show that the variations of geochemical parameters substantially shaped the indigenous microbial communities. Sharp environmental gradients also impacted the microbial metabolic potentials, especially for C, N, and S cycling. Although the relative abundances of carbon fixing genes did not significantly vary along the environmental gradients, the taxa for carbon fixation varied significantly in more contaminated fields versus less contaminated fields, indicating the effects of AMD contamination on the autotrophic microbial communities. AMD input also influenced the N cycling, especially for nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In addition, ex situ experiments were undertaken to evaluate the effects of AMD contamination on nitrogen fixation rates. Random Forest (RF) analysis indicated that nitrate, pH, total N, TOC exhibited positive correlations with the rates of nitrogen fixation while total Fe, Fe(III), and sulfate showed negative effects. Two co-occurrence networks at taxonomic and genomic levels indicated that geochemical parameters such as pH, TOC, total N, total S, and total Fe substantially influenced the innate microbial communities and their metabolic potentials.

However, the effects of introduced mangrove species on diazotrophic communities remain unclear. Here, we analyzed rhizosphere and endosphere diazotrophic communities between native mangrove species (Avicennia marina) and introduced mangrove species (Sonneratia apetala and Laguncularia racemose) by sequencing nifH gene amplicons. Our results showed that S. apetala and L. racemose introduction significantly (P<0.05) increased nutrition components (e.g., total carbon and total nitrogen) in rhizosphere, as well as the diazotrophs richness in rhizosphere and endosphere. The relative abundance of clusters III diazotrophs in the rhizosphere and Rhizobium in the endosphere were significantly increased with L. racemosa or S. apetala introduction. Fe and pH were the main environmental factors driving the divergence of endophyte-rhizophyte diazotrophs between native and introduced mangroves. The correlation-based network analyses indicated that the interaction among rhizophyte-endophyte diazotrophs is more harmonious in native mangrove, while there exist more competition in introduced mangroves.

A 2-year field plot experiment verified that the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris increased peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yields and significantly increased nodulation and N2 fixation regardless of whether N fertilizers were added. Root exudates collected from P. liquidambaris-colonized plants significantly improved nodulation and N2 fixation. Rhizosphere stimulation experiments further showed that colonized root exudates had significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3 -) concentrations, with decreased abundance and diversity of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). In contrast, the abundance and diversity of diazotrophs significantly increased, and most diazotrophs identified were peanut nodulation-related strains (Bradyrhizobium sp.). P. liquidambaris symbiosis increased the expression of phenolic and flavonoid synthesis-related genes, and the derived phenolics and flavonoids could effectively increase the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and nodC gene expression (nodulation-related biological processes) of the Bradyrhizobium strain. Metabolic pattern analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids are more likely to accumulate to higher levels in the rhizosphere soil of peanuts colonized with P. liquidambaris Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed the underlying mechanisms for the P. liquidambaris-induced improvement in nodulation and N2 fixation, i.e., that the specific root exudates derived from P. liquidambaris colonization decrease nitrate concentration and increase the population and biological activities of peanut nodulation-related Bradyrhizobium species, which beneficially enhance peanut-Bradyrhizobium interactions. Therefore, this study is the ﬁrst to provide new insight into a positive relationship between an exotic endophytic fungus, crop nodulation, and N2 fixation increase.IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth; however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that endophytic fungal colonization with P. liquidambaris significantly increased the productivity, nodulation, and N2 fixation of peanuts through the secretion of specific root exudates. We provide a reasonable mechanism explaining how P. liquidambaris promotes peanut nodulation and N2 fixation, whereby the specific root exudates produced by P. liquidambaris colonization decrease rhizosphere soil nitrate (NO3-) and increase the population and biological activities of peanut-nodulating-related Bradyrhizobium strains, which is beneficial to enhancing the peanut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic interaction. Our study provides reliable empirical evidence to show the mechanism of how an exotic endophytic fungus drives an increase in nodulation and N2 fixation, which will be helpful in erecting a resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural system.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"24","1","0","0","21","0","25",NA,NA,"","2150-7511",NA,"MEDLINE:31311876","31311876",NA

New aerosolized antibiotic formulations have recently been introduced (such as inhaled aztreonam), and others are in development (inhaled levofloxacin and liposomal amikacin). Licensed dry powder formulations include tobramycin inhalation powder and dry powder colistimethate (available in Europe). Although inhaled antibiotics have the advantage of being able to deliver high intrapulmonary concentrations of drug, antimicrobial resistance can still develop and is a concern in CF. Antimicrobial resistance might be mitigated by using non-antibiotic treatments, antibiotic adjuvants, which have activity against bacteria. Examples include agents such as gallium, antimicrobial peptides and anti-biofilm compounds such as alginate oligosaccharides (OligoG) and garlic. Vaccination strategies and antibody therapy (IgY) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been attempted to prevent initial infection with this organism in CF. Although aggressive and long-term use of antibiotics has been crucial in slowing lung function decline and improving survival in people with CF, it has added a significant burden of care and associated toxicities in these individuals. Careful surveillance and the use of preventative strategies for antibiotic related toxicity (such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity) are essential.

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is one of the PHAs with biocompatibility and fine mechanical properties, but its production is limited by the low level of intracellular propionyl-CoA.RESULTS: L-Isoleucine producing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain WM001 were analyzed by genome and transcriptomesequencing. The results showed that the most over-expressed genes in WM001 are relevant not only to L-isoleucine production but also to propionyl-CoA accumulation. Compared to the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13869, the transcriptional levels of the genes prpC2, prpD2, and prpB2, which are key genes relevant to propionyl-CoA accumulation, increased 26.7, 25.8, and 28.4-folds in WM001, respectively; and the intracellular level of propionyl-CoA increased 16.9-fold in WM001. When the gene cluster phaCAB for PHA biosynthesis was introduced into WM001, the recombinant strain WM001/pDXW-8-phaCAB produced 15.0g/L PHBV with high percentage of 3-hydroxyvalerate as well as 29.8g/L L-isoleucine after fed-batch fermentation. The maximum 3-hydroxyvalerate fraction in PHBV produced by WM001/pDXW-8-phaCAB using glucose as the sole carbon source could reach 72.5%, which is the highest reported so far.CONCLUSIONS: Genome and transcriptome analysis showed that C. glutamicum WM001 has potential to accumulate L-isoleucine and propionyl-CoA pool.

The feasibility of enhancing production of an endophyte-derived beneficial alkaloid through introduction of an additional gene copy was assessed in a proof-of-concept study. Sexual and asexual Epichloe species that form symbiotic associations with cool-season grasses of the Poaceae sub-family Pooideae produce bioactive alkaloids that confer resistance to herbivory by a number of organisms. Of these, peramine is thought to be crucial for protection of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) from the Argentinian stem weevil, an economically important exotic pest in New Zealand, contributing significantly to pasture persistence. A single gene (perA) has been identified as solely responsible for peramine biosynthesis and is distributed widely across Epichloe taxa. In the present study, a functional copy of the perA gene was introduced into three recipient endophyte genomes by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The target strains included some that do not produce peramine, and others containing different perA gene copies. Mitotically stable transformants generated from all three endophyte strains were able to produce peramine in culture and in planta at variable levels. In summary, this study provides an insight into the potential for artificial combinations of alkaloid biosynthesis in a single endophyte strain through transgenesis, as well as the possibility of using novel genome editing techniques to edit the perA gene of non-peramineproducing strains.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"16","0","0","0","15","0","16",NA,NA,"","1617-4623",NA,"MEDLINE:30443676","30443676",NA

To expand on Escherichia coli SCFA products, we previously implemented a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to a diverse group of short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. To increase product titers and reduce premature pathway termination products, we conducted in vivo and in vitro analyses to understand and improve the specificity of the acyl-CoA thioesterase enzyme, which releases fatty acids from CoA. A total of 62 putative bacterial thioesterases, including 23 from the cow rumen microbiome, were inserted into a pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA molecule derived from exogenously provided propionic or isobutyric acid. Functional screening revealed thioesterases that increase production of saturated (valerate), unsaturated (trans-2-pentenoate), and branched (4-methylvalerate) SCFAs compared to overexpression of E. coli thioesterase tesB or native expression of endogenous thioesterases. To determine if altered thioesterase acyl-CoA substrate specificity caused the increase in product titers, six of the most promising enzymes were analyzed in vitro. Biochemical assays revealed that the most productive thioesterases rely on promiscuous activity but have greater specificity for product-associated acyl-CoAs than for precursor acyl-CoAs. In this study, we introduce novel thioesterases with improved specificity for saturated, branched, and unsaturated short-chain acyl-CoAs, thereby expanding the diversity of potential fatty acid products while increasing titers of current products.

This process involves packages of symbiotic genes on mobile genetic elements that are readily transferred within or between rhizobial species, furnishing the recipient with the ability to interact with plant hosts. However, it remains elusive whether plant host migration has played a role in shaping the current distribution of genetic variation in symbiotic genes. Herein, we examined the genetic structure and phylogeographic pattern of symbiotic genes in 286 symbiotic strains of Mesorhizobium nodulating black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), a cross-continental invasive legume species that is native to North America. We conducted detailed phylogeographic analysis and approximate Bayesian computation to unravel the complex demographic history of five key symbiotic genes. The sequencing results indicate an origin of symbiotic genes in Germany rather than North America. Our findings provide strong evidence of prehistoric lineage splitting and spatial expansion events resulting in multiple radiations of descendent clones from founding sequence types worldwide. Estimates of the timescale of divergence in North American and Chinese subclades suggest that black locust-specific symbiotic genes have been present in these continent many thousands of years before recent migration of plant host. Although numerous crop plants, including legumes, have found their centers of origin as centers of evolution and diversity, the number of legume-specific symbiotic genes with a known geographic origin is limited.

Furthermore, rodent blood was plated on brain heart infusion blood agar, and isolates were verified as Bartonella species using citrate synthase gene- (gltA) specific primers. One hundred and four fleas recovered from R. rattus were also tested for the presence of Bartonella species using the same gltA primer set.

Genotypes related to Bartonella elizabethae, a known zoonotic pathogen, were detected in three R. rattus and one C. gambianus. Bartonella strains, similar to bacteria detected in indigenous rodents from other African countries, were isolated from the blood of A. niloticus. Bartonellae, similar to bacteria initially cultured from Ornithodorus sonrai (soft tick) from Senegal, were found in two C. gambianus. Interestingly, bartonellae detected in fleas from invasive rats were similar to bacteria identified in indigenous rodents and not their rat hosts, with an overall prevalence of 6.7%. These results suggest that if fleas are competent vectors of these bartonellae, humans residing in these two districts of Uganda are potentially at greater risk for exposure to Bartonella species from native rodents than from invasive rats. The low prevalence of bartonellae in R. rattus was quite surprising, in contrast, to the detection of these organisms in a large percentage of Rattus species from other geographical areas.

Pesticide-degrading bacteria were recently added to a waterworks sand filter in an attempt to remediate pesticide-polluted drinking water. The density of the introduced bacteria, however, decreased rapidly, which was partly attributed to predation by protozoa in the sand filter. This study investigated the effects of indigenous sand filter protozoa on the population density and degradation efficiency of degrader bacteria introduced into sand from a waterworks sand filter. The 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM)-degrading bacterium Aminobacter sp. MSH1 was used as a model organism. The introduction of MSH1 at high cell densities was followed by a >1000-fold increase in the protozoan population size and at the same time a 29% reduction in Aminobacter cell numbers. The protozoan population in the systems that had MSH1 added at a lower density only increased 50-fold, and a decrease in Aminobacter numbers was not detectable. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of Aminobacter and in BAM degradation efficiency was seen in flow-through sand filter columns inoculated with MSH1 and fed BAM-contaminated water, when comparing sand columns containing the indigenous microbial filter community, i.e. containing protozoa, to columns with sterilised sand. These results suggest that degrader bacteria introduced into waterworks sand filters are adversely affected by grazing from the indigenous protozoa, reducing the size of the degrader population and the sand filter degradation efficiency.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10","0","0","0","7","0","10",NA,NA,"","1432-0614",NA,"MEDLINE:27437935","27437935",NA

Many variants of these protocols have been developed, each with their own strengths. Currently there is no systematic means for simulating sequence data from this family of sequencing protocols, potentially hindering the advancement of algorithms to exploit this new datatype.Findings: We describe a computational simulator that, given simple parameters and reference genome sequences, will simulate Hi-C sequencing on those sequences. The simulator models the basic spatial structure in genomes that is commonly observed in Hi-C and 3C datasets, including the distance-decay relationship in proximity ligation, differences in the frequency of interaction within and across chromosomes, and the structure imposed by cells. A means to model the 3D structure of randomly generated topologically associating domains is provided. The simulator considers several sources of error common to 3C and Hi-C library preparation and sequencing methods, including spurious proximity ligation events and sequencing error.Conclusions: We have introduced the first comprehensive simulator for 3C and Hi-C sequencing protocols. We expect the simulator to have use in testing of Hi-C data analysis algorithms, as well as more general value for experimental design, where questions such as the required depth of sequencing, enzyme choice, and other decisions can be made in advance in order to ensure adequate statistical power with respect to experimental hypothesis testing.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"11","0","0","0","10","0","11",NA,NA,"","2047-217X",NA,"MEDLINE:29149264","29149264",NA

In both applications bacterial suspensions are oftentimes physically introduced into plant tissues using hand-driven pressure from a needleless syringe. While effective, this approach has several drawbacks that limit reproducibility. Pressure must be provided with the syringe perfectly perpendicular to the tissue surface. The researcher must also attempt to provide even and consistent pressure, both within and between experimental replicates. These factors mean that the procedures do not always translate well between research groups or biological replicates.RESULTS: We have devised a method to introduce Agrobacterium suspensions into plant leaves with greater reproducibility. Using a decommissioned dissecting microscope as an armature, a syringe body with the bacterial suspension is mounted to the nosepiece. Gentle, even pressure is applied by rotating the focus knob.

The nematode induces a feeding structure - the syncytium - which it keeps alive for the duration of the life cycle and on which it depends for all nutrients required to develop to the adult stage. Interactions of G. pallida with the host are mediated by effectors, which are produced in two sets of gland cells. These effectors suppress host defences, facilitate migration and induce the formation of the syncytium.RESULTS: The recent completion of the G. pallida genome sequence has allowed us to identify the effector complement from this species. We identify 128 orthologues of effectors from other nematodes as well as 117 novel effector candidates. We have used in situ hybridisation to confirm gland cell expression of a subset of these effectors, demonstrating the validity of our effector identification approach. We have examined the expression profiles of all effector candidates using RNAseq; this analysis shows that the majority of effectors fall into one of three clusters of sequences showing conserved expression characteristics (invasive stage nematode only, parasitic stage only or invasive stage and adult male only). We demonstrate that further diversity in the effector pool is generated by alternative splicing. In addition, we show that effectors target a diverse range of structures in plant cells, including the peroxisome. This is the first identification of effectors from any plant pathogen that target this structure.CONCLUSION: This is the first genome scale search for effectors, combined to a life-cycle expression analysis, for any plant-parasitic nematode. We show that, like other phylogenetically unrelated plant pathogens, plant parasitic nematodes deploy hundreds of effectors in order to parasitise plants, with different effectors required for different phases of the infection process.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"47","2","0","0","45","0","48",NA,NA,"","1471-2164",NA,"MEDLINE:25342461","25342461",NA

Ralstonia eutropha is a biotechnologically useful aerobic bacterium that uses the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) for CO2 utilization, suggesting that it may be a useful host to bioselect RubisCO molecules with improved CO2 -capture capabilities. A host strain of R. eutropha was constructed for this purpose after deleting endogenous genes encoding two related RubisCOs. This strain could be complemented for CO2 -dependent growth by introducing native or heterologous RubisCO genes. Mutagenesis and suppressor selection identified amino acid substitutions in a hydrophobic region that specifically influences RubisCO's interaction with its substrates, particularly O2 , which competes with CO2 at the active site. Unlike most RubisCOs, the R. eutropha enzyme has evolved to retain optimal CO2 -fixation rates in a fast-growing host, despite the presence of high levels of competing O2 . Yet its structure-function properties resemble those of several commonly found RubisCOs, including the higher plant enzymes, allowing strategies to engineer analogous enzymes. Because R. eutropha can be cultured rapidly under harsh environmental conditions (e.g., with toxic industrial flue gas), in the presence of near saturation levels of oxygen, artificial selection and directed evolution studies in this organism could potentially impact efforts toward improving RubisCO-dependent biological CO2 utilization in aerobic environments.ENZYMES: d-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, EC 4.1.1.39; phosphoribulokinase, EC 2.7.1.19.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"20","1","0","0","14","0","20",NA,NA,"","1742-4658",NA,"MEDLINE:27261087","27261087",NA

Here, we describe reporter systems based on the CU promoter and three reporter proteins (GFP, GUS and LUC), developed as research tools for quantitative and qualitative studies of DED in vitro, in vivo and in planta. A strain of the aggressive species Ophiostoma novo-ulmi was transformed with the reporter constructs using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the fungal transformants, namely M75-GFP, M75-GUS and M75-LUC, were examined for mitotic stability after repeated subcultures. The intensity of GFP fluorescence was strong in M75-GFP spores and hyphae, allowing microscopic investigations of spore structure, fungal morphogenesis and fungal development. The interaction of M75-GFP and U. americana callus cells was explored with scanning laser confocal microscopy facilitating qualitative studies on fungal strategies for the invasion and penetration of elm cells. M75-GUS was generated to provide an invasive, yet quantitative approach to study fungal-plant interactions in vitro and in planta. The generation of M75-LUC transformants was aimed at providing a non-destructive quantitative approach to study the role of CU in vivo. The sensitivity, low background signal and linearity of LUC assays all predict a very reliable approach to investigate and re-test previously claimed roles of this CU in fungal pathogenicity.

The introduction of multiple resistance (R) genes with different spectra from crossable species into potato varieties is required. Cisgenesis is a promising approach that introduces native genes from the crops own gene pool using GM technology, thereby retaining favourable characteristics of established varieties.RESULTS: We pursued a cisgenesis approach to introduce two broad spectrum potato late blight R genes, Rpi-sto1 and Rpi-vnt1.1 from the crossable species Solanum stoloniferum and Solanum venturii, respectively, into three different potato varieties. First, single R gene-containing transgenic plants were produced for all varieties to be used as references for the resistance levels and spectra to be expected in the respective genetic backgrounds. Next, a construct containing both cisgenic late blight R genes (Rpi-vnt1.1 and Rpi-sto1), but lacking the bacterial kanamycin resistance selection marker (NPTII) was transformed to the three selected potato varieties using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Gene transfer events were selected by PCR among regenerated shoots. Through further analyses involving morphological evaluations in the greenhouse, responsiveness to Avr genes and late blight resistance in detached leaf assays, the selection was narrowed down to eight independent events. These cisgenic events were selected because they showed broad spectrum late blight resistance due to the activity of both introduced R genes. The marker-free transformation was compared to kanamycin resistance assisted transformation in terms of T-DNA and vector backbone integration frequency. Also, differences in regeneration time and genotype dependency were evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a marker-free transformation pipeline to select potato plants functionally expressing a stack of late blight R genes. Marker-free transformation is less genotype dependent and less prone to vector backbone integration as compared to marker-assisted transformation. Thereby, this study provides an important tool for the successful deployment of R genes in agriculture and contributes to the production of potentially durable late blight resistant potatoes.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"68","0","1","0","56","0","70",NA,NA,"","1472-6750",NA,"MEDLINE:24885731","24885731",NA

To determine whether the GAANTRY system can be used to engineer a monocotyledonous crop, two new T-DNA constructs, carrying five (16.9kb) or eleven (37.4kb) cargo sequences were assembled and transformed into rice.

Additionally, more than 18% of the lines were high-quality events containing a single copy of the introduced transgenes and were free of sequences from outside of the T-DNA.

The orchid genus Dendrobium contains species that have both ornamental value and medicinal importance. There is thus interest in producing cultivars that have increased resistance to pests, novel horticultural characteristics such as novel flower colours, improved productivity, longer flower spikes, or longer post-harvest shelf-life. Tissue culture is used to establish clonal plants while in vitro flowering allows for the production of flowers or floral parts within a sterile environment, expanding the selection of explants that can be used for tissue culture or genetic transformation. The latter is potentially the most effective, rapid and practical way to introduce new agronomic traits into Dendrobium. Most (69.4 %) Dendrobium genetic transformation studies have used particle bombardment (biolistics) while 64 % have employed some form of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A singe study has explored ovary injection, but no studies exist on floral dip transformation.

Chloroplast transformation has exhibited various positive effects as compared to nuclear transformation. This is a more preferred technique by researchers. To carry out chloroplast transformation, the vector design must be performed, and a selectable marker needs to be incorporated before the chloroplast could uptake the construct. The common way of introducing a gene into the host, which is the chloroplast, involves the biolistic, PEG-mediated, carbon nanotubes carriers, UV-laser microbeam, and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation approaches. Apart from discussing the processes involved in introducing the gene into the chloroplast, this review also focuses on the various applications brought about by chloroplast transformation, particularly in the field of agriculture and environmental science.CONCLUSION: Chloroplast transformation has shown a lot of advantages and proven to be a better alternative compared to nuclear genome transformation.

These techniques have the potential to enrich our understanding of bacterial species relevant to human health, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, owing to the novelty of these techniques, their use is still confined to addressing very particular applications, and their availability is limited owing to associated costs and required expertise. Among these, scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for exploring important optical properties at nanoscale resolution, depending only on the size of a sharp tip. Despite its huge potential to resolve aspects that cannot be tackled otherwise, the penetration of s-SNOM into the life sciences is still proceeding at a slow pace for the aforementioned reasons.RESULTS: In this work we introduce SSNOMBACTER, a set of s-SNOM images collected on 15 bacterial species. These come accompanied by registered Atomic Force Microscopy images, which are useful for placing nanoscale optical information in a relevant topographic context.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed dataset aims to augment the popularity of s-SNOM and for accelerating its penetration in life sciences. Furthermore, we consider this dataset to be useful for the development and benchmarking of image analysis tools dedicated to s-SNOM imaging, which are scarce, despite the high need. In this latter context we discuss a series of image processing and analysis applications where SSNOMBACTER could be of help.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3","0","0","0","2","0","3",NA,NA,"","2047-217X",NA,"MEDLINE:33231675","33231675",NA

The few formal experimental phage clinical trials that have been completed to date have produced inconclusive results on the efficacy of phage therapy, which contradicts the many successful treatment outcomes observed in historical accounts and recent individual case reports. It would therefore be wise to identify why such a discordance exists between trials and compassionate use in order to better develop future phage treatment and clinical applications. The multitude of observations reported over the years in the literature constitutes an invaluable experience, and we add to this by presenting a number of cases of patients treated compassionately with phages throughout the past decade with a focus on osteoarticular infections. Additionally, an abundance of scientific literature into phage-related areas is transforming our knowledge base, creating a greater understanding that should be applied for future clinical applications. Due to the increasing number of treatment failures anticipatedfrom the perspective of a possible post-antibiotic era, we believe that the introduction of bacteriophages into the therapeutic arsenal seems a scientifically sound and eminently practicable consideration today as a substitute or adjuvant to antibiotic therapy.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"59","0","1","0","37","0","59",NA,NA,"","1999-4915",NA,"MEDLINE:30597868","30597868",NA

The management of such a problem includes the intensive use of insecticides to reduce vector populations and risk of pathogen transmission. As an alternative to synthetic insecticides to control D. citri, the present study determined the chemical composition of diverse plant essential oils and assessed the toxicity and repellency of oil extracts against D. citri. Their chemical composition and abundance were determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Adults and nymphs were exposed to leaf citrus discs treated by spraying or immersion with different oil extract concentrations. Repellency was assessed by exposing adults to treated leaves in experimental arenas and determining the number of insects remaining on the leaf after different time periods compared with the control. The main oil compounds in the tested plants were anethole, verbenone, 4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-hexene, 4-allylanisole, and trans-tagetone. Oils from Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Schinus molle L. caused no repellent or insecticide effects on D. citri. In contrast, oil extracts from the Foeniculum vulgare Mill. and Tagetes species were toxic and/or repellent for both adults and nymphs. There was a positive relationship between toxicity and concentration. Oil extracts from Tagetes lucida, T. coronopifolia, and T. terniflora were repellent (> 92%) at 40 mg mL-1; this was correlated with the concentration and decreased over time. Essential oils extracts from the Tagetes species could represent a potential defense that could be integrated into the management of D. citri.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","2","2","4",NA,NA,"0718-5839","",NA,"SCIELO:S0718-58392019000400636",NA,NA

The genomic differences between representative strains of the two symbiovars are, however, relatively small. This introduced a need for a dataset representing a larger bacterial population in order to make better conclusions on characteristics typical for a subset of the species. In this study, we produced draft genomes of eight strains of N. galegae having different symbiotic phenotypes, both with regard to host specificity and nitrogen fixation efficiency. These genomes were analysed together with the previously published complete genomes of N. galegae strains HAMBI 540T and HAMBI 1141.RESULTS: The results showed that the presence of an additional rpoN sigma factor gene in the symbiosis gene region is a characteristic specific to symbiovar orientalis, required for nitrogen fixation. Also the nifQ gene was shown to be crucial for functional symbiosis in both symbiovars. Genome-wide analyses identified additional genes characteristic of strains of the same symbiovar and of strains having similar plant growth promoting properties on Galega orientalis. Many of these genes are involved in transcriptional regulation or in metabolic functions.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that the only symbiosis-related gene that is present in one symbiovar of N. galegae but not in the other is an rpoN gene. The specific function of this gene remains to be determined, however. New genes that were identified as specific for strains of one symbiovar may be involved in determining host specificity, while others are defined as potential determinant genes for differences in efficiency of nitrogen fixation.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10","0","0","0","10","0","10",NA,NA,"","1471-2164",NA,"MEDLINE:25933608","25933608",NA

Effective control of invasive pathogens often requires coordinated concerted action of a large group of stakeholders. Both epidemiological and human behavioural factors influence the outcome of a disease control campaign. In mathematical models that are frequently used to guide such campaigns, human behaviour is often ill-represented, if at all. Existing models of human, animal and plant disease that do incorporate participation or compliance are often driven by pay-offs or direct observations of the disease state. It is however very well known that opinion is an important driving factor of human decision making. Here we consider the case study of Citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), which is an acute bacterial disease that threatens the sustainability of citrus production across the world. We show how by coupling an epidemiological model of this invasive disease with an opinion dynamics model we are able to answer the question: What makes or breaks the effectiveness of a disease control campaign? Frequent contact between stakeholders and advisors is shown to increase the probability of successful control. More surprisingly, we show that informing stakeholders about the effectiveness of control methods is of much greater importance than prematurely increasing their perceptions of the risk of infection. We discuss the overarching consequences of this finding and the effect on human as well as plant disease epidemics.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"6","0","0","0","5","0","6",NA,NA,"","1553-7358",NA,"MEDLINE:32027649","32027649",NA

Although plants can be attacked by phytopathogenic bacteria, they are more often engaged in neutral or mutualistic bacterial interactions. In the soil, plants associate with rhizobia or other plant growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria; above ground, bacteria colonise plants as epi- and endophytes. For mounting appropriate responses, such as permitting colonisation by beneficial symbionts while at the same time fending off pathogenic invaders, plants need to distinguish between the good and the bad. Plants make use of proteins containing the lysin motif (LysM) for perception of N-acetylglucosamine containing carbohydrate structures, such as chitooligosaccharides functioning as symbiotic nodulation factors or bacterial peptidoglycan. Moreover, plant hydrolytic enzymes of the chitinase family, which are able to cleave bacterial peptidoglycan or chitooligosaccharides, are essential for cellular signalling induced by rhizobial nodulation factors during symbiosis as well as bacterial peptidoglycan during pathogenesis. Hence, LysM receptors seem to work in concert with hydrolytic enzymes that fine-tune ligand availability to either allow symbiotic interactions or trigger plant immunity.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5","0","0","0","5","0","5",NA,NA,"","1618-0607",NA,"MEDLINE:31079999","31079999",NA

Only recently, the microbiota of free-living European reptiles have been investigated, however, on the basis of small samples, mainly in protected areas.

Nineteen species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. The most common species were: Aeromonas hydrophila, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella spp. The bacteria prevalent in N. natrix cloacal swabs are likely to represent the natural intestinal Gram-negative microbiota of the examined snakes. Importantly, the identified bacteria are pathogenic to humans, which clearly highlights the epidemiological potential of free-living N. natrix. The risk of infection is high for immunocompromised humans, children (under 5years old), elderly persons, and pregnant women.

Using this method, many transgenic plants carrying multiple genes-of-interest could be produced without untransformed escape. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a promising biomass crop for bioenergy. To obtain transgenic switchgrass plants carrying a multi-gene trait in a simple manner, an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method was established by constructing a Gateway-based binary vector, optimizing transformation conditions and developing a novel selection method. A MultiRound Gateway-compatible destination binary vector carrying the bar selectable marker gene, pHKGB110, was constructed to introduce multiple genes of interest in a single transformation. Two reporter gene expression cassettes, GUSPlus and gfp, were constructed independently on two entry vectors and then introduced into a single T-DNA region of pHKGB110 via sequential LR reactions. Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA101 carrying the resultant binary vector pHKGB112 and caryopsis-derived compact embryogenic calli were used for transformation experiments. Prolonged cocultivation for 7 days followed by cultivation on media containing meropenem improved transformation efficiency without overgrowth of Agrobacterium, which was, however, not inhibited by cefotaxime or Timentin. In addition, untransformed escape shoots were completely eliminated during the rooting stage by direct dipping the putatively transformed shoots into the herbicide Basta solution for a few seconds, designated as the 'herbicide dipping method'. It was also demonstrated that more than 90 % of the bar-positive transformants carried both reporters delivered from pHKGB112.

Because of the increasing resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to INH, mainly associated with mutations in the katG gene, new INH-based compounds have been proposed to circumvent this problem. In this work, we present a detailed comparative study of the molecular determinants of the interactions between wt KatG or its S315T mutant form and either INH or INH-C10, a new acylated INH derivative. MD simulations were used to explore the conformational space of both proteins, and results indicate that the S315T mutation did not have a significant impact on the average size of the access tunnel in the vicinity of these residues. Our simulations also indicate that the steric hindrance role assigned to Asp137 is transient and that electrostatic changes can be important in understanding the enzyme activity data of mutations in KatG. Additionally, molecular docking studies were used to determine the preferred modes of binding of the two substrates. Upon mutation, the apparently less favored docking solution for reaction became the most abundant, suggesting that S315T mutation favors less optimal binding modes. Moreover, the aliphatic tail in INH-C10 seems to bring the hydrazine group closer to the heme, thus favoring the apparent most reactive binding mode, regardless of the enzyme form. The ITC data is in agreement with our interpretation of the C10 alkyl chain role and helped to rationalize the significantly lower experimental MIC value observed for INH-C10. This compound seems to be able to counterbalance most of the conformational restrictions introduced by the mutation, which are thought to be responsible for the decrease in INH activity in the mutated strain. Therefore, INH-C10 appears to be a very promising lead compound for drug development.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12","0","0","0","9","0","12",NA,NA,"","1543-8392",NA,"MEDLINE:25590860","25590860",NA

Different responses were induced by T3SS in a host genotype-dependent manner.

They are well known in Central and South America where they transmit Trypanosoma cruzi to mammals, including humans, through their feces. This parasitic protozoan is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a major public health issue in endemic areas. Because of the medical and economic impact of Chagas disease, the presence of other arthropod-borne pathogens in triatomines was rarely investigated.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, seven triatomines species involved in the transmission of T. cruzi were molecularly screened for the presence of known pathogens generally associated with arthropods, such as Rickettsia, Bartonella, Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia species and Coxiella burnetii. Of all included triatomine species, only Eratyrus mucronatus specimens tested positive for Bartonella species for 56% of tested samples. A new genotype of Bartonella spp. was detected in 13/23 Eratyrus mucronatus specimens, an important vector of T. cruzi to humans. This bacterium was further characterized by sequencing fragments of the ftsZ, gltA and rpoB genes. Depending on the targeted gene, this agent shares 84% to 91% of identity with B. bacilliformis, the agent of Carrion's disease, a deadly sandfly-borne infectious disease endemic in South America. It is also closely related to animal pathogens such as B. bovis and B. chomelii.CONCLUSIONS: As E. mucronatus is an invasive species that occasionally feeds on humans, the presence of potentially pathogenic Bartonella-infected bugs could present another risk for human health, along with the T. cruzi issue.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"14","1","0","0","13","0","15",NA,NA,"","1935-2735",NA,"MEDLINE:28095503","28095503",NA

Genetic circuits allow responding to these environmental stimuli to optimize physiological adaptations during the switch from the free-living to the symbiotic life style. A pivotal regulatory system of the nitrogen-fixing soybean endosymbiont Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens for efficient symbiosis is the general stress response (GSR), which relies on the alternative sigma factor sigmaEcfG However, the GSR-controlled process required for symbiosis has not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that biosynthesis of trehalose is under GSR control, and mutants lacking the respective biosynthetic genes otsA and/or otsB phenocopy GSR-deficient mutants under symbiotic and selected free-living stress conditions. The role of trehalose as a cytoplasmic chemical chaperone and stress protectant can be functionally replaced in an otsA or otsB mutant by introducing heterologous genetic pathways for biosynthesis of the chemically unrelated compatible solutes glycine betaine and (hydroxy)ectoine. Alternatively, uptake of exogenously provided trehalose also restores efficient symbiosis and tolerance to hyperosmotic and hyperionic stress of otsA mutants. Hence, elevated cytoplasmic trehalose levels resulting from GSR-controlled biosynthesis are crucial for B. diazoefficiens cells to overcome adverse conditions during early stages of host infection and ensure synchronization with root nodule development.IMPORTANCE The Bradyrhizobium-soybean symbiosis is of great agricultural significance and serves as a model system for fundamental research in bacterium-plant interactions. While detailed molecular insight is available about mutual recognition and early nodule organogenesis, our understanding of the host-imposed conditions and the physiology of infecting rhizobia during the transition from a free-living state in the rhizosphere to endosymbiotic bacteroids is currently limited. In this study, we show that the requirement of the rhizobial general stress response (GSR) during host infection is attributable to GSR-controlled biosynthesis of trehalose. Specifically, trehalose is crucial for an efficient symbiosis by acting as a chemical chaperone to protect rhizobia from osmostress during host infection.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","3","0","4",NA,NA,"","2150-7511",NA,"MEDLINE:33785618","33785618",NA

Heavy and light chain gene sequences of a CCP monoclonal antibody (CCP mAb) were cloned from the hybridoma cell (12G1) and introduced into two separate plant expression vectors under the control of the rice alpha-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter system. The vectors were introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. Integration of the CCP mAb genes into rice chromosomes was confirmed by a genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction and expression was verified by northern blot analysis of mRNA. The in vivo assembly and secretion of CCP mAb occurred in transgenic rice cell suspension culture under the RAmy3D expression system; accumulated CCP mAbs in the medium were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. Immunoblot assays and ELISA showed these plant-produced CCP mAbs successfully bound to a synthetic CCP antigen.

Along with many other agricultural technologies, the global production of genetically engineered crops has steadily grown since they were first introduced 25 years ago. Since the first transfer of DNA into plant cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, different transformation methods have enabled rapid advances in molecular breeding approaches to bring crop varieties with novel traits to the market that would be difficult or not possible to achieve with conventional breeding methods. Today, transformation to produce genetically engineered crops is the fastest and most widely adopted technology in agriculture. The rapidly increasing number of sequenced plant genomes and information from functional genomics data to understand gene function, together with novel gene cloning and tissue culture methods, is further accelerating crop improvement and trait development. These advances are welcome and needed to make crops more resilient to climate change and to secure their yield for feeding the increasing human population. Despite the success, transformation remains a bottleneck because many plant species and crop genotypes are recalcitrant to established tissue culture and regeneration conditions, or they show poor transformability. Improvements are possible using morphogenetic transcriptional regulators, but their broader applicability remains to be tested. Advances in genome editing techniques and direct, non-tissue culture-based transformation methods offer alternative approaches to enhance varietal development in other recalcitrant crops.

About 23% of root-associated community variation was correlated with an application of the inoculant, which was accompanied by increased cooperation between taxa belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota phyla and decreased cooperation between Firmicutes in plant roots. Additionally, a decrease in bacterial Shannon diversity and an increase in the relative abundances of Rhizobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were detected in the roots of inoculated plants relative to the non-inoculated control. A strong effect of the inoculation on the bacterial cooperation was also detected after 1 year of plant field growth, whereas no differences in bacterial community composition and also alpha and beta diversities were detected between bacterial communities from inoculated and non-inoculated roots. These findings suggest that while exogenous endophytes might have a short-term effect on the root microbiome structure and composition, they can boost cooperation between plant-growth-promoting endophytes, which can exist for the extended period of time providing the host-plant with long-lasting beneficial effects.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"1664-302X","",NA,"MEDLINE:35479645","35479645",NA

Plants encounter Fe deficiency when grown in calcareous soil with low Fe availability, leading to reduced crop yield and agricultural problem. Rice acquires Fe from the soil via Strategy I-related system (ferrous ion uptake by OsIRT1) and Strategy II system (ferric ion uptake by chelation). However, rice plants have a weak ability in Fe(III) reduction and phytosiderophore secretion. We previously produced an Fe deficiency-tolerant rice harboring OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 (for higher Fe(III) reductase ability) and a 35S promoter-OsIRO2 (for higher phytosiderophore secretion). In this study, we produced a new Fe deficiency-tolerant rice by the additional introduction of a barley IDS3 genome fragment with refre1/372 and OsIRO2 (named as IRI lines) for further enhancement in Strategy II phytosiderophore productivity and better growth performance in various environments. Our results show that an enhanced tolerance was observed in OsIRO2 introduced line at the early growth stage, refre1/372 introduced line in the late stage, and RI line in all stages among five types of cultivation method. Moreover, we demonstrated that new IRI rice lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to Fe deficiency compared to nontransgenic (NT) rice and rice lines harboring the overexpressing OsIRO2 or the IDS3 fragment under submerged calcareous soil. The yields of IRI lines were ninefold higher than the NT line. Furthermore, under Fe-limited nonsubmerged calcareous soil condition (a new cultivation condition), IRI lines also conferred enhanced tolerance than NT, lines introducing only the OsIRT1 promoter-refre1/372 or overexpressing OsIRO2, and lines harboring both. Our results demonstrate that further enhancement of the Strategy II Fe uptake system by the mugineic acid synthase gene in addition to Fe uptake by enhanced ferric Fe reduction and phytosiderophore production in rice contributes Fe deficiency tolerance and broaden its utility in calcareous soil cultivation under paddy or nonpaddy field conditions.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","1","0","0","8","0","9",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:31681346","31681346",NA

However, the functions of annexins in diverse biological processes in rice are largely unclear.RESULTS: Herein, we report that OsANN4, a calcium-binding rice annexin protein, was induced by abscisic acid (ABA). Under ABA treatment, the plants in which OsANN4 was knocked down by RNA interference showed some visible phenotypic changes compared to the wild type, such as a lower rooting rate and shorter shoot and root lengths. Moreover, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities of the RNAi lines were significantly lower and further resulted in higher accumulation of O2.- and H2O2 than those of the wild-type. A Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) assay showed that ABA-induced net Ca2+ influx was inhibited in OsANN4 knockdown plants. Interestingly, the phenotypic differences caused by ABA were eliminated in the presence of LaCl3 (Ca2+ channel inhibitor). Apart from this, we demonstrated that OsCDPK24 interacted with and phosphorylated OsANN4. When the phosphorylated serine residue of OsANN4 was substituted by alanine, the interaction between OsANN4 and OsCDPK24 was still observed, however, both the conformation of OsANN4 and its binding activity with Ca2+ might be changed.CONCLUSIONS: OsANN4 plays a crucial role in the ABA response, partially by modulating ROS production, mediating Ca2+ influx or interacting with OsCDPK24.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","0","0","1",NA,NA,"","1471-2229",NA,"MEDLINE:34663209","34663209",NA

Despite enormous advances in the molecular genetics of this symbiosis between plants and nodulating bacteria, we still do not understand fundamental aspects which determine the efficiency of N2 fixation in the nodules, and therefore the capacity to biologically enrich agricultural soils.

Therefore, the IPUT1 gene plays an important role in the genetic improvement of crop salt tolerance. Herein, the IbIPUT1 gene, which encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtIPUT1, from sweet potato was cloned. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated in vivo transgenic technology, non-invasive micro-measuring technology (NMT) and Na+ fluorescence imaging technology were then combined to quickly study the potential function of IbIPUT1 in salt tolerance. The data showed that IbIPUT1 was involved in the regulation of root cell Na+ balance, and the overexpression of IbIPUT1 could not promote sweet potato root cell Na+ efflux under salt stress, but it could significantly inhibit the Na+ absorption of root cells, thereby reducing the accumulation of Na+ in root cells under salt stress. Additionally, Ca2+ efflux in transgenic root cells was slightly higher than that in control roots under salt stress.

We addressed these factors in populations of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), a generalist herbivore that vectors a bacterial pathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum, causal pathogen of zebra chip disease) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Genome-wide SNP data revealed two major genetic clusters-psyllids collected from potato crops were genetically similar to psyllids found on a common weed, Lycium spp., but dissimilar from those found on another common non-crop host, Solanum dulcamara L. Most psyllids found on Lycium spp. and potato represented a single mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotype that has been suggested to not be native to the region, and whose arrival may have been concurrent with zebra chip disease first emerging. The putatively introduced COI haplotype usually co-occurred with endosymbiotic Wolbachia, while the putatively resident COI haplotype generally did not. Genetic intermediates between the two genetic populations of insects were rare, consistent with recent sympatry or reproductive isolation, although admixture patterns of apparent hybrids were consistent with introgression of genes from introduced into resident populations. Our results suggest that both host-plant associations and endosymbionts are shaping the population genetic structure of sympatric psyllid populations associated with different non-crop hosts. It is of future interest to explicitly examine vectorial capacity of the two populations and their potential hybrids, as population structure and hybridization might alter regional vector capacity and disease outbreaks.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","1","0","0","7","0","9",NA,NA,"1752-4571","",NA,"MEDLINE:33294020","33294020",NA

Methods: In a 2007 avian influenza exposure study, we recruited persons with varying wild bird exposures. Using sera from this study, we tested for antibodies to Cryptosporidium spp., Echinococcus spp., Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella spp., Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, California serogroup bunyaviruses, and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Results: Eight hundred eighty-seven persons had sera tested, including 454 subsistence bird hunters and family members, 160 sport bird hunters, 77 avian wildlife biologists, and 196 persons with no wild bird exposure. A subset (n=481) of sera was tested for California serogroup bunyaviruses. We detected antibodies to 10/11 pathogens. Seropositivity to Cryptosporidium spp. (29%), California serotype bunyaviruses (27%), and G. intestinalis (19%) was the most common; 63% (301/481) of sera had antibodies to at least one pathogen. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, Cryptosporidium spp. seropositivity was higher in females (35.7% vs. 25.0%; p=0.01) and G. intestinalis seropositivity was higher in males (21.8% vs. 15.5%; p=0.02). Alaska Native persons were more likely than non-Native persons to be seropositive to C. burnetii (11.7% vs. 3.8%; p=0.005) and less likely to be seropositive to HEV (0.4% vs. 4.1%; p=0.01).

Biochemical carbon-concentrating mechanisms such as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which improves photosynthetic, water-use, and possibly nutrient-use efficiency, represent a strategic target for synthetic biology to engineer more productive C3 crops for a warmer and drier world. One key challenge for introducing multigene traits like CAM onto a background of C3 photosynthesis is to gain a better understanding of the dynamic spatial and temporal regulatory events that underpin photosynthetic metabolism. With the aid of systems and computational biology, vast amounts of experimental data encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be related in a network to create dynamic models. Such models can undergo simulations to discover key regulatory elements in metabolism and suggest strategic substitution or augmentation by synthetic components to improve photosynthetic performance and water-use efficiency in C3 crops. Another key challenge in the application of synthetic biology to photosynthesis research is to develop efficient systems for multigene assembly and stacking. Here, we review recent progress in computational modelling as applied to plant photosynthesis, with attention to the requirements for CAM, and recent advances in synthetic biology tool development.

This study analyzed the effects of Typhoon Wipha (Code: 1907) on microplastics abundance and composition in surface water and sediment crossed coastal areas of Shenzhen. Here we found a significant typhoon-induced increase in microplastics abundance in surface water, whereas an opposite trend was observed in sediment. Despite the evident transportation of microplastics from sediment to surface water by agitation, a possible microplastics influx was introduced by typhoon as evidenced by the large attribution of unknown force in source tracking analysis. Furthermore, typhoon had adeptly uniformed the plastisphere community in the sediment along the 190km costal line overnight. A significant increase of nitrogen fixer, Bradyrhizobiaceae, was observed ubiquitously after typhoon, which might alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal ecological system. Together, this study expanded the knowledge about the impact of typhoon-induced influx of the microplastics on coastal biogeochemical cycling.

In this procedure, two recombinase recognition target sequences are introduced into known positions of a bacterial genome through single cross-over plasmid integration. Subsequent expression of the site-specific recombinase mediates recombination between the two target sequences, resulting in the excision of the intervening region and its loss from the genome. We further illustrate how this deletion system can be readily adapted to function as a large-scale in vivo cloning procedure, in which the region excised from the genome is captured as a replicative plasmid. We next provide a procedure for the metabolic analysis of bacterial large-scale genome deletion mutants using the Biolog Phenotype MicroArray system.

To determine the frequency, risk factors and spatial distribution of ruminant brucellosis in Jordan, a nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted. Small ruminant flocks (n=333) and cattle herds (n=204) were randomly selected, and their disease status was ascertained by testing individual serum samples using the Rose Bengal Test and a competitive ELISA (sheep and goats) and milk samples using an indirect ELISA (cattle). Information on putative risk factors was collected using standardized questionnaires. A logistic model with a binomial outcome was built to identify risk factors for being seropositive. The estimated true seroprevalence values were 18.1% (95% CI: 11-25.3) (cattle-only herds), 22.2% (95% CI: 16.5-28.8) (sheep flocks), 45.4% (95% CI: 30.3-61.6) (goat herds), 70.4% (95% CI: 55.5-84.9) (mixed sheep-goat flocks), 34.3% (95% CI: 28.4, 40.4) (all small ruminant flocks) and 38.5% (95% CI: 24.3-51.8) (mixed herds of cattle and small ruminants). Only 1.5% of small ruminant flocks were vaccinated. The seroprevalence was higher in northern areas, where livestock density is also higher. The logistic model fitted the data well and had a very high predictive ability. In the small ruminant model, five variables were significantly associated with a higher odds of seropositivity: lending/borrowing rams (OR=8.9, 95% CI: 3.0-26.1), feeding aborted material to dogs (OR=8.0, 95% CI: 3.5-18.1) the presence of goats (OR=6.9, 95% CI: 3.1-15.4), introducing new animals to the flock (OR=5.8, 95% CI: 2.5-13.6), and a large flock size (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.0-4.6). Conversely, separating newly introduced animals (OR=0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.47), separating animals that had aborted (OR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.46) and using disinfectants to clean pens (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.83) were significantly associated with a lower odds of being seropositive. The main risk factor for cattle herds being seropositive was the introduction of new animals (OR=11.7, 95% CI: 2.8-49.4); while separation of newly introduced animals (OR=0.09, 95% CI: 0.03-0.29), herd disinfection (OR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.15) and having calving pens (OR=0.14, 95% CI: 0.05-0.43) significantly reduced the odds of infection. Brucellosis is endemic at high levels across Jordan, and the current vaccination programme, which is limited to small ruminants, has very low coverage. A revised brucellosis control programme is required in Jordan. Given the high baseline prevalence, it should be based on vaccination accompanied by measures to promote hygiene and husbandry practices that minimize the risk of introduction and maintenance of Brucella spp., and thereby the risk of human infection.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"38","0","0","0","21","0","38",NA,NA,"","1873-1716",NA,"MEDLINE:25619944","25619944",NA

Three MoAST genes were bioinformatically analyzed, of which MoAST2 was uniquely upregulated when invasive hyphae switched to necrotrophic pathogenesis. MoAST2 deletion (DeltaMoast2) caused a drastic reduction in conidiogenesis and appressorium formation. Particularly, DeltaMoast2 was observed to be proliferated at the biotrophic phase but inhibited at the necrotrophic stage, and with invisible symptoms detected, suggesting a critical role in necrotrophic phase. Glutamate family restored the DeltaMoast2 defects but aspartate family did not, inferring that transamination occurs from aspartate to glutamine. MoAST2 is cytosolic and possessed H2O2 stress tolerance. In parallel, Colletotrichum graminicola AST2, CgAST2 was proven to be a player in necrotrophic anthracnose development.

Phylogenomic studies indicate that this nitrogen-fixing nodulation trait has a single evolutionary origin. In legume model plants, the molecular interaction between plant and rhizobium microsymbiont is mapped to a significant degree. A specific LysM-type receptor kinase, LjEPR3 in Lotus japonicus and MtLYK10 in Medicago truncatula, was found to act in a secondary identity-based mechanism, controlling intracellular rhizobium infection. Furthermore, LjEPR3 showed to bind surface exopolysaccharides of Mesorhizobium loti, the diazotrophic microsymbiont of L. japonicus. EPR3 orthologous genes are not unique to legumes. Surprisingly, however, its ortholog EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE RECEPTOR (EPR) is pseudogenized in Parasponia, the only lineage of non-legume plants that nodulate also with rhizobium.RESULTS: Analysis of genome sequences showed that EPR3 orthologous genes are highly conserved in nodulating plants. We identified a conserved retrotransposon insertion in the EPR promoter region in three Parasponia species, which associates with defected transcriptional regulation of this gene. Subsequently, we studied the EPR gene of two Trema species as they represent the sister genus of Parasponia for which it is assumed it lost the nitrogen-fixing nodulation trait. Both Trema species possess apparently functional EPR genes that have a nodulation-specific expression profile when introduced into a Parasponia background. This indicates the EPR gene functioned in nodulation in the Parasponia-Trema ancestor.CONCLUSION: We conclude that nodule-specific expression of EPR3 orthologous genes is shared between the legume and Parasponia-Trema lineage, suggesting an ancestral function in the nitrogen-fixing nodulation trait. Pseudogenization of EPR in Parasponia is an exceptional case in nodulating plants. We speculate that this may have been instrumental to the microsymbiont switch -from Frankia to rhizobium- that has occurred in the Parasponia lineage and the evolution of a novel crack entry infection mechanism.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","0","0","1",NA,NA,"","1471-2229",NA,"MEDLINE:35490231","35490231",NA

The expression of the introduced genes in T2 seeds was confirmed by qPCR. Methanol extracts of transgenic rice grains were analyzed by LC/MS to detect the production of PPD and dammarenediol-II (DD). The production of both PPD and DD was identified not only by comparing the retention times but also mass fraction patterns of authentic PPD and DD standards.

Thus, depending on various geochemical conditions, sediment could either be a sink or source for As and Sb in the water column. Microbes are key mediators for biogeochemical transformation and can both mobilize or precipitate As and Sb. To further understand the microbial community responses to As and Sb contamination, sediment samples with different contamination levels were collected from three rivers.

Cultured isolates from lung sputum reveal high inter- and intraindividual variability in pathogen strains, sequence variants, and phenotypes; disease progression likely depends on the precise combination of infecting lineages. Routine clinical protocols, however, provide a limited overview of the colonizer populations. Therefore, a more comprehensive and precise identification and characterization of infecting lineages could assist in making corresponding decisions on treatment. Here, we describe longitudinal tracking for four cystic fibrosis patients who exhibited extreme clinical phenotypes and, thus, were selected from a pilot cohort of 11 patients with repeated sampling for more than a year. Following metagenomics sequencing of lung sputum, we find that the taxonomic identity of individual colonizer lineages can be easily established. Crucially, even superficially clonal pathogens can be subdivided into multiple sublineages at the sequence level. By tracking individual allelic differences over time, an assembly-free clustering approach allows us to reconstruct multiple lineage-specific genomes with clear structural differences. Our study showcases a culture-independent shotgun metagenomics approach for longitudinal tracking of sublineage pathogen dynamics, opening up the possibility of using such methods to assist in monitoring disease progression through providing high-resolution routine characterization of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.IMPORTANCE Cystic fibrosis patients frequently suffer from recurring respiratory infections caused by colonizing pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Although modern therapies can sometimes alleviate respiratory symptoms by ameliorating residual function of the protein responsible for the disorder, management of chronic respiratory infections remains an issue. Here, we propose a minimally invasive and culture-independent method to monitor microbial lung content in patients with cystic fibrosis at minimal additional effort on the patient's part. Through repeated sampling and metagenomics sequencing of our selected cystic fibrosis patients, we successfully classify infecting bacterial lineages and deconvolute multiple lineage variants of the same species within a given patient.

To further understand the symbioses evolution in Rhizobiaceae, we analyzed the pan-genome of this family based on 92 genomes of type/reference strains and reconstructed its phylogeny using a phylogenomics approach. Intriguingly, although the genetic expansion that occurred in chromosomal regions was the main reason for the high proportion of low-frequency flexible gene families in the pan-genome, gene gain events associated with accessory plasmids introduced more genes into the genomes of nitrogen-fixing species. For symbiotic plasmids, although horizontal gene transfer frequently occurred, transfer may be impeded by, such as, the host's physical isolation and soil conditions, even among phylogenetically close species. During coevolution with leguminous hosts, the plasmid system, including accessory and symbiotic plasmids, may have evolved over a time span, and provided rhizobial species with the ability to adapt to various environmental conditions and helped them achieve nitrogen fixation. These findings provide new insights into the phylogeny of Rhizobiaceae and advance our understanding of the evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","0","0","1",NA,NA,"","1759-6653",NA,"MEDLINE:32687170","32687170",NA

Rj2 generates two distinct transcript variants in its expression profile through alternative splicing. Alternative splicing of Rj2 is caused by the retention of the 86-bp intron 4. Inclusion of intron 4 in mature mRNA introduces an in-frame stop codon; as such, the alternative transcript is predicted to encode a truncated protein consisting of the entire portion of the TIR, NBS and LRR domains but missing the C-terminal domain of the full-length Rj2 protein encoded by the regular transcript. Since alternative splicing has been shown to be essential for full activity of several plant R genes, we attempted to test whether the alternative splicing is required for Rj2-mediated nodulation restriction.

The trichome phenotype of 35S:miR319a plants could be abolished by introducing a miR319a-resistant form of TCP19. Furthermore, the miR319a-targeted TCP19 interacted directly with REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA), a downstream repressor of GA signaling.

In this study, sonication followed by vacuum infiltration is shown to increase agroinfiltration-mediated GUS expression in soybean. Agroinfiltration, a valuable tool for rapid analysis of gene function, has been used extensively on leaf tissue of Nicotiana benthamiana and several other plant species. However, the application of this approach for gene functionality studies in soybean has been largely unsuccessful. Improvements in agroinfiltration of many plants have been achieved through a variety of approaches to allow better delivery, penetration and infection of Agrobacterium to interior leaf tissues. In this work, an agroinfiltration approach was developed for transient expression in soybean utilizing sonication followed by vacuum infiltration of intact seedlings. The optimal infiltration buffer, sonication time, and vacuum conditions for agroinfiltration of soybean were evaluated by monitoring expression of an introduced beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. The developed method included the use of an infiltration buffer (10mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 10mM MgCl2, 100M acetosyringone) supplemented with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, with 30s sonication followed by vacuum infiltration. These techniques were further applied to evaluate five different Agrobacterium strains and six different plant genetic backgrounds. Among the Agrobacterium strains examined, J2 produced the highest levels of GUS activity and 'Peking' was the most responsive genotype.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"26","1","0","0","26","0","28",NA,NA,"","1432-203X",NA,"MEDLINE:25326714","25326714",NA

The emergence of virulent, non-typeable strains (NTHi) emphasizes the importance of developing new interventional targets.

Clustering identified ten SLR-containing gene subfamilies, each with various numbers of SLRs per gene. Individual strains also had varying numbers of SLR-containing genes from one or more of the subfamilies. Statistical genetic analyses of gene possession among 210 NTHi strains typed as either disease or carriage found a significant association between possession of the SlrVA subfamily (which we have termed, macrophage survival factor, msf) and the disease isolates. The PittII strain contains four chromosomally contiguous msf genes. Deleting all four of these genes (msfA1-4) (KO) resulted in a highly significant decrease in phagocytosis and survival in macrophages; which was fully complemented by a single copy of the msfA1 gene. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media and invasive disease, the KO strain displayed a significant decrease in fitness compared to the WT in co-infections; and in single infections, the KO lost its ability to invade the brain. The singly complemented strain showed only a partial ability to compete with the WT suggesting gene dosage is important in vivo. The transcriptional profiles of the KO and WT in planktonic growth were compared using the NTHi supragenome array, which revealed highly significant changes in the expression of operons involved in virulence and anaerobiosis. These findings demonstrate that the msfA1-4 genes are virulence factors for phagocytosis, persistence, and trafficking to non-mucosal sites.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"13","0","0","0","9","0","14",NA,NA,"","1932-6203",NA,"MEDLINE:26977929","26977929",NA

Modern agriculture is facing a pressing situation where novel strategies must be developed for sustainable food production and security. Biostimulants, conceptually defined as non-nutrient substances or microorganisms with the ability to promote plant growth and health, represent the potential to provide sustainable and economically favorable solutions that could introduce novel approaches to improve agricultural practices and crop productivity. Current knowledge and phenotypic observations suggest that biostimulants potentially function in regulating and modifying physiological processes in plants to promote growth, alleviate stresses, and improve quality and yield. However, to successfully develop novel biostimulant-based formulations and programs, understanding biostimulant-plant interactions, at molecular, cellular and physiological levels, is a prerequisite. Metabolomics, a multidisciplinary omics science, offers unique opportunities to predictively decode the mode of action of biostimulants on crop plants, and identify signatory markers of biostimulant action. Thus, this review intends to highlight the current scientific efforts and knowledge gaps in biostimulant research and industry, in context of plant growth promotion and stress responses. The review firstly revisits models that have been elucidated to describe the molecular machinery employed by plants in coping with environmental stresses. Furthermore, current definitions, claims and applications of plant biostimulants are pointed out, also indicating the lack of biological basis to accurately postulate the mechanisms of action of plant biostimulants.

Here we reported a plantlet regeneration and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol by using Ma bamboo young shoots as explants. Under our optimized conditions, embryogenic calluses were successfully induced from the excised young shoots on callus induction medium and rapidly grew on callus multiplication medium. Shoots and roots were regenerated on shoot induction medium and root induction medium, respectively, with high efficiency. An Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation protocol of Ma bamboo was established, verified by PCR and GUS staining. Furthermore, the maize Lc gene under the control of the ubiquitin promoter was successfully introduced into Ma bamboo genome and generated an anthocyanin over-accumulation phenotype.

There are no approved vaccines for the prevention of human disease and those used for animal brucellosis have adverse properties, which limit their application. We investigated the immunological and protective effects of recombinant 16 kDa outer membrane protein of Brucella abortus (Omp16) which introduced a new candidate for brucellosis subunit vaccine.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brucella Omp16 gene was cloned in pET-23a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Recombinant Omp16 (rOmp16) was purified using nickel resin and confirmed by Western blot analysis. BALB/c mice were immunized with rOmp16, afterward, specific serum antibodies and cytokine responses were evaluated. Protection of immunized mice against pathogenic B. abortus 544 and B. melitensis 16M was evaluated by the intraperitoneal bacterial challenge.RESULTS: Sequencing results of the recombinant plasmid vector along with Western blotting confirmed the cloning procedure. Recognition of rOmp16 by specific IgG from serum samples of infected cases suggests the stimulation of immune response to this protein. Significant total serum IgG along with remarkable IgG1 and IgG2a response to the protein was recorded. A significant increase in IFN-gamma, and IL-4 levels were observed from splenocyte cultures of immunized mice which were stimulated with rOmp16 suggesting the development of T-lymphocyte mediated immunity against the recombinant antigen.CONCLUSION: The intraperitoneal challenge with B. abortus 544 and B. melitensis 16M confirmed that rOmp16 is able to elicit efficient protective immune responses in the animal host.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","1","0","0","4","0","9",NA,NA,"2008-3866","",NA,"MEDLINE:32128095","32128095",NA

Fog droplets can also contain bacterial and fungal aerosols, but our understanding of fog biology is limited. Using metagenomic tools and culturing, we provide a unique look at fungal and bacterial communities in fog at two fog-dominated sites: coastal Maine (USA) and the Namib Desert (Namibia). Microbial communities in the fog at both sites were diverse, distinct from clear aerosols, and influenced by both soil and marine sources. Fog from both sites contained Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, commonly soil- and air-associated phyla, but also contained bacterial taxa associated with marine environments including Cyanobacteria, Oceanospirillales, Novosphingobium, Pseudoalteromonas, and Bradyrhizobiaceae. Marine influence on fog communities was greatest near the coast, but still evident in Namib fogs 50 km inland. In both systems, differences between pre- and post-fog aerosol communities suggest that fog events can significantly alter microbial aerosol diversity and composition. Fog is likely to enhance viability of transported microbes and facilitate their deposition, making fog biology ecologically important in fog-dominated environments. Fog may introduce novel species to terrestrial ecosystems, including human and plant pathogens, warranting further work on the drivers of this important and underrecognized aerobiological transfer between marine and terrestrial systems.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22","0","0","0","19","0","22",NA,NA,"","1879-1026",NA,"MEDLINE:30180359","30180359",NA

RC1 that catalyses the specific cleavage of halide ion from L-2-halocarboxylic acids to produce the corresponding D-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids.

Therefore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area calculations, the current study theoretically investigated the molecular basis of DehL enantiospecificity.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to optimize sowing dates for two peanut genotypes ('BARI-2016' and 'NO-334') in Thal region (Layyah).

The highest seed yield was obtained with early sown crop (10th April) during both years. Pod formation reduced with increasing atmospheric temperature and no pods were formed on the plants sown on 30th June. Decreased pod formation seemed a major reason for low yield in late-sown crop. The highest yield was observed for the crop sown on 10th April, which was decreased by 40% for the crop sown on 1st May.

Using SC-PCR, we found that single-copy T-DNA integrations were more frequent in transgenic T1 Arabidopsis without a vector backbone. On the basis of this phenomenon, we combined the negative screen of the vector backbone and SC-PCR to efficiently identify single-copy T-DNA plants. We found that T-DNA copy number detection was underestimated in transgenic plants containing inverted T-DNA repeats due to hairpin structures formed during PCR, indicating that PCR-based methods for detecting T-DNA copy number should be reevaluated. We solved this problem by releasing T-DNA from the complex structures using restriction enzymes before performing SC-PCR. We also demonstrated that latent Agrobacterium contamination in the T1 transgenic Arabidopsis generated by the floral dip method was exceedingly low and may not affect the detection of T-DNA copy number.

Thus, animal health authorities have to set priorities for better focusing their scarce resources. The main objective of this study was to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels, to ensure better targeting of animal health resources. A second objective was to investigate whether the targeted surveillance programmes resulting from this rationalized approach would also benefit the local communities engaged in livestock production. A multi-criteria prioritization process was developed, involving local experts, to score and rank 132 animal diseases based on their priority at the regional and national levels for four PICTs: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which form part of a regional Food Animal Biosecurity Network. In parallel interviews with farmers and field animal health and production workers were conducted to assess their perception of animal diseases. The list of the top-twenty ranked diseases for the Pacific Islands region shows a mix of endemic zoonotic diseases (such as leptospirosis ranked first; brucellosis third; tuberculosis sixth; and endoparasites and ectoparasites, respectively eleventh and thirteenth) with exotic diseases (such as HPAI ranked second, FMD fifth, and rabies ninth). There were different disease ranking lists for each of the four targeted PICTs, confirming different strategies of disease prevention and control may be required for each country, rather than a regional approach. Interviewed animal health and production workers were unfamiliar with most of the prioritized diseases and a majority acknowledged that they would not be able to recognize clinical signs if outbreaks were to occur in their area. Leptospirosis, which is endemic and identified as the top priority disease at the regional level, was never mentioned by any interviewed farmer. Farmers did not name any emerging infectious diseases as priorities. Instead, they identified endemic diseases (parasites, flu, coccidiosis, and scabies) as the most important. While animal disease priorities appear to differ widely between the targeted regions and countries, it also varies significantly between experts and farmers. Better targeted surveillance programmes may thus result in more rational and transparent allocation of resources, and thus enhanced food security, but may not directly match the needs of the local communities.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"14","1","0","0","12","0","14",NA,NA,"","1873-6254",NA,"MEDLINE:25572609","25572609",NA

Results: Putative transgenic plants were screened in a selection medium containing 50 mg/L kanamycin and 30 mg/L meropenem. Integration of the foreign gene in plant genome was confirmed by PCR. Expression of foreign gene was analyzed at transcription level by RT-PCR and at translation level by means of dot blotting and ELISA. All analyses confirmed the expression of recombinant protein. Conclusion: Developments in genetic engineering have led to plant-based systems for recombinant vaccine production. In this research, tobacco plant was used to express F and HN epitopes of NDV.

To understand the epidemiological route of CLas and ACP in newly invaded regions of Sichuan and thereby better establish an HLB interception zone ranging from Leibo to Yibin, we evaluated the molecular variability of 19 CLas draft genomes from citrus or dodder (Cuscuta campestris). They include three type-specific prophage loci, three variable number tandem repeat loci, a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element, and population diversity of 44 ACP mitochondrial genomes. The results indicated that CLas isolates in the newly invaded area (Pingshan) were more diverse than those in the HLB endemic areas (Leibo and Ningnan). Phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial genomes demonstrated that ACPs in Leibo, Pingshan, and Xuzhou (rural areas) represent a new mitochondrial group (MG4), distinguished by the three unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms in cox1, nad4, and cytb.

The gradual process of deterioration was real-time monitored utilising laser Fraunhofer diffraction patterns. Additionally, a small hydrophilic molecule, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF), was loaded into the PCL microchamber arrays in a dry state; however, the substantial permeability of the PCL film led to leakage of the dye molecules. Consequently, polylactic acid (PLA) was blended with PCL to reduce its permeability, enabling blended PCL-PLA (1:2 ratio correspondingly) microchamber arrays to trap the small hydrophilic molecule CF. PCL-PLA (1:2) microchamber arrays hold potential for controlled release under the catalysis of lipase within 26 hours. Additionally, it is calculated that approximately 11 pg of CF dye crystals was loaded into individual microchambers of 10 mum size, indicating that the microchamber array films could yield a highly efficient encapsulation.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15","0","1","0","6","0","16",NA,NA,"","1744-6848",NA,"MEDLINE:32039413","32039413",NA

The highest sequence identities and closest phylogenetic relationships for the begomovirus, beta-satellite, and alpha-satellite detected in P. hysterophorus plants were to Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV), papaya leaf curl beta-satellite (PaLCuB), and Ageratum yellow vein India alpha-satellite (AYVIA), respectively. These findings identified the virus and satellites infecting the Parthenium sp. as ToLCV, PaLCuB, and AYVIA, respectively. P. hysterophorus and tomato seedlings infected with cloned ToLCV, PaLCuB, and AYVIA by agroinoculation developed leaf curl symptoms, whereas plants infected with ToLCV alone or with ToLCV and AYVIA developed mild yellowing. The results show that this complex infects and causes disease in P. hysterophorus and tomato. P. hysterophorus is an invasive weed commonly found around agricultural fields and along roadsides in India. These results indicate that P. hysterophorus plants infected with ToLCV and associated satellite DNA act as an alternate host (reservoir), and that could lead to increased incidence of tomato leaf curl disease.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"6","0","0","0","5","0","6",NA,NA,"0191-2917","",NA,"MEDLINE:30682918","30682918",NA

Production of PPTfrom natural ginseng plants requires artificial deglycosylation procedures of ginsenosides via enzymatic or physicochemical treatments. Metabolic engineering could be an efficient technology for production of ginsenoside sapogenin. For PPT biosynthesis in Panax ginseng, damarenediol-II synthase (PgDDS) and two cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP716A47 and CYP716A53v2) are essentially required.METHODS: Transgenic tobacco co-overexpressing P.ginseng PgDDS, CYP716A47, and CYP716A53v2 was constructed via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.RESULTS: Expression of the three introduced genes in transgenic tobacco lines was confirmed by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Analysis of liquid chromatography showed three new peaks, dammarenediol-II (DD), protopanaxadiol (PPD), and PPT, in leaves of transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco (line 6) contained 2.8mug/g dry weight (DW), 7.3mug/g DW, and 11.6mug/g DW of PPT, PPD, and DD in leaves, respectively. Production of PPT was achieved via cell suspension culture and was highly affected by auxin treatment. The content of PPT in cell suspension was increased 37.25-fold compared with that of leaves of the transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco was not able to set seeds because of microspore degeneration in anthers. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that cells of phloem tissue situated in the center of the anther showed an abnormally condensed nuclei and degenerated mitochondria.CONCLUSION: We successfully achieved the production of PPT in transgenic tobacco.

Currently, molecular, serological, and microbiological methods are used for diagnosis of this disease. In this study we examined ELISA, PCR and serum agglutination (SAT) methods on human patient serum samples.METHODS: A total of 100 serum samples were collected from suspected patients. Fifty serum samples gave a positive result with the Wright test. The ELISA method was first employed on all samples for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against Brucella. Subsequently, the rapid PCR methodology was used to identify presence of Brucella genome in 500 L of each serum sample. The B4/B5 primer pair was used for PCR amplification.RESULTS: Out of the 100 serum samples obtained from patients with suspected brucellosis, 50 samples tested positive by SAT and displayed high titers of 1/160. Of these 50 positive samples, 49 samples were positive as per the ELISA test whereas one sample tested negative. The PCR test was conducted on all 100 serum samples and results showed that the 45 serum samples that gave a positive agglutination test were also positive by PCR.CONCLUSIONS: Various laboratory methods have been used or introduced for the detection of Brucella. Molecular methods such as PCR, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of bacteria, have also been reported.

Reactions containing asymmetric benzimidazoles as substrates for homologues of CobT from different bacteria resulted in the production of distinct ratios of two isomeric products, with some CobT homologues favoring the production of a single isomer and others forming a mixture of products. These preferences were reflected in the production of cobamide isomers with lower ligands attached in different orientations, some of which are novel cobamides that have not been characterized previously. Two isomers of methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide were found to be unequal in their ability to support ethanolamine ammonia-lyase dependent growth in Salmonella enterica, suggesting that CobT's regiospecificity could be biologically important. We also observed differences in pKa, which can influence the reactivity of the cofactor and could contribute to these distinct biological activities. Relaxed regiospecificity was achieved by introducing a single point mutation in an active site residue of CobT. These new cobamide isomers could be used to probe the mechanisms of cobamide-dependent enzymes.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"11","0","0","0","11","0","11",NA,NA,"","1520-4995",NA,"MEDLINE:25412146","25412146",NA

Little is known about the symbiotic potential of indigenous SNB in Central Europe and the interaction with an SNB inoculum from commercial products. The objective of this study was to quantify the capacity of indigenous and inoculated SNB strains on the symbiotic performance of soybean in a pot experiment, using soils with and without soybean history. Under controlled conditions in a growth chamber, the study focused on two main factors: a soybean cropping interval (time since the last soybean cultivation; SCI) and inoculation with commercial Bradyrhizobia strains. Comparing the two types of soil, without soybean history and with 1-4 years SCI, we found out that plants grown in soil with soybean history and without inoculation had significantly more root nodules and higher nitrogen content in the plant tissue. These parameters, along with the leghemoglobin content, were found to be a variable among soils with 1-4 years SCI and did not show a trend over the years. Inoculation in soil without soybean history showed a significant increase in a nodulation rate, leghemoglobin content, and soybean tissue nitrogen concentration. The study found that response to inoculation varied significantly as per locations in soil with previous soybean cultivation history. An inoculated soybean grown on loamy sandy soils from the location Muncheberg had significantly more nodules as well as higher green tissue nitrogen concentration compared with non-inoculated plants. No significant improvement in a nodulation rate and tissue nitrogen concentration was observed for an inoculated soybean grown on loamy sandy soils from the location Fehrow. These results suggest that introduced SNB strains remained viable in the soil and were still symbiotically competent for up to 4 years after soybean cultivation. However, the symbiotic performance of the SNB remaining in the soils was not sufficient in all cases and makes inoculation with commercial products necessary. The SNB strains found in the soil of Central Europe could also be promising candidates for the development of inoculants and already represent a contribution to the successful cultivation of soybeans in Central Europe.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","2","0","4",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:34149745","34149745",NA

Reconstructing a phylogenetic tree of these taxa is generally a crucial step in any evolutionary analysis. Instead of constructing genome assemblies for all taxa, annotating these assemblies, and aligning orthologous genes, many recent studies 1) directly map raw sequencing reads to a single reference sequence, 2) extract single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 3) infer the phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood methods from the aligned SNP positions. However, here we show that, when using such methods to reconstruct phylogenies from sets of simulated sequences, both the exclusion of nonpolymorphic positions and the alignment to a single reference genome, introduce systematic biases and errors in phylogeny reconstruction. To address these problems, we developed a new method that combines alignments from mappings to multiple reference sequences and show that this successfully removes biases from the reconstructed phylogenies. We implemented this method as a web server named REALPHY (Reference sequence Alignment-based Phylogeny builder), which fully automates phylogenetic reconstruction from raw sequencing reads.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"242","2","4","0","213","1","250",NA,NA,"","1537-1719",NA,"MEDLINE:24600054","24600054",NA

We also found that our strategy was more sensitive than other available HGT detection methods. These HGT events were mainly mediated by symbiotic plasmids.

Citrus embryogenic cell cultures can be used to rapidly produce a large population of genome edited transformed citrus lines. The ability to introduce specific mutations in the genome of these cells using two constructs (pC-PDS1 and pC-PDS2) was evaluated in this study.RESULTS: Citrus sinensis 'EV2' embryogenic cell cultures are amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting two locations in the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene were either driven by the Arabidopsis U6-26 promoter (pC-PDS1) or assembled as a Csy4 array under the control of the CmYLCV promoter (pC-PDS2). All transgenic embryos were completely albino and no variegated phenotype was observed. We evaluated 12 lines from each construct in this study and the majority contain either insertion (1-2bp), substitution (1bp), or deletion (1-3bp) mutations that occurred close to the protospacer adjacent motif.CONCLUSIONS: Both the pC-PDS1 and pC-PDS2 could successfully edit the citrus embryogenic cell cultures. However, the editing efficiency was dependent on the gRNA, confirming that the selection of a proper gRNA is essential for successful genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique.

HR occurred in a limited region around the gRNA target site. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HR) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. 'SR-1') was achieved using binary vectors comprising two (T1-T2) or three (T1-T2-T3) independent T-DNA regions. For HR donor with the tobacco acetolactate synthase gene, SuRB, T-DNA1 contained DeltaSuRBW568L, which lacked the N-terminus region of SuRB and was created by three nucleotide substitutions (ATG to GCT; W568L), leading to herbicide chlorsulfuron (Cs) resistance, flanked by the hygromycin (Hm)-resistant gene. T-DNA2 consisted of the hSpCas9 gene and two gRNA inserts targeting SuRB and An2. For the 2nd HR donor with the tobacco An2 gene encoding a MYB transcription factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, T-DNA3 had a 35S promoter-driven An2 gene lacking the 3rd exon resulting in anthocyanin accumulation after successful HR. After selecting for Hm and Cs resistance from among the 7462 Agrobacterium-inoculated explants, 77 independent lines were obtained. Among them, the ATG to GCT substitution of endogenous SuRB was detected in eight T1-T2-derived lines and two T1-T2-T3-derived lines. Of these mutations, four T1-T2-derived lines were bi-allelic. All the HR events occurred across the endogenous SuRB and 5' homology arm of the randomly integrated T-DNA1. HR of the SuRB paralog, SuRA, was also found in one of the T1-T2-derived lines. Sequence analysis of its SuRA-targeted region indicated that the HR occurred in a limited (<153bp) region around the gRNA target site. Even though some T1-T2-T3-derived lines introduced three different T-DNAs and modified the An2 gRNA target site, no signs of HR in the endogenous An2 could be observed.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5","0","0","0","4","0","5",NA,NA,"","1432-203X",NA,"MEDLINE:30006757","30006757",NA

To circumvent this, it has been proposed to implement the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), principally consisting of bicarbonate transporters and carboxysomes, into plant chloroplasts. As it is currently not possible to recover homoplasmic transplastomic monocots, foreign genes must be introduced in these plants via nuclear transformation. Consequently, it is paramount to ensure that resulting proteins reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment, which for cyanobacterial transporters BicA and SbtA, is the chloroplast inner-envelope membrane (IEM). At present, targeting signals to redirect large transmembrane proteins from non-chloroplastic organisms to plant chloroplast envelopes are unknown. The goal of this study was to identify such signals, using agrobacteria-mediated transient expression and confocal microscopy to determine the sub-cellular localization of 37 GFP-tagged chimeras. Initially, fragments of chloroplast proteins known to target soluble cargos to the stroma were tested for their ability to redirect BicA, but they proved ineffective. Next, different N-terminal regions from Arabidopsis IEM transporters were tested. We demonstrated that the N-terminus of AtHP59, AtPLGG1 or AtNTT1 (92-115 amino acids), containing a cleavable chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) and a membrane protein leader (MPL), was sufficient to redirect BicA or SbtA to the chloroplast envelope. This constitutes the first evidence that nuclear-encoded transmembrane proteins from non-chloroplastic organisms can be targeted to the envelope of plant chloroplasts; a finding which represents an important advance in chloroplast engineering by opening up the door to further manipulation of the chloroplastic envelope.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"37","1","0","0","36","0","38",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:26973659","26973659",NA

Our analyses reveal interspecies transmission. Two outbreaks (2007, 2008) in Montana cattle had B. abortus genotypes similar to isolates from both bison and elk. Nevertheless, similarity in elk and cattle isolates from the 2008 outbreak suggest that elk are the likely source of brucellosis transmission to cattle in Montana and Wyoming. Brucella abortus isolates from sampling in Montana appear to be divided in two clusters: one found in local Montana elk, cattle, and bison; and another found mainly in elk and a bison from Wyoming, which is consistent with brucellosis having entered Montana via migration of infected elk from Wyoming. Our findings illustrate complex patterns of brucellosis transmission among elk, bison, and cattle as well as the utility of VNTRs to infer the wildlife species of origin for disease outbreaks in livestock.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","0","0","0","7","0","8",NA,NA,"","1943-3700",NA,"MEDLINE:28118557","28118557",NA

Lower starch contents and anatomical aberration levels in the phloem were observed in transgenic lines having enhanced resistance compared with CLas-infected WT plants. CiNPR4 overexpression changed the jasmonic acid, but not salicylic acid, level. Additionally, the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid levels increased after CLas infection.

Microbiota are confirmed to affect the development and immunity of mosquitoes. However, scientists have focused more on midgut microbiota of female mosquitoes and bacterial differences between female and male Aedes mosquitoes. The relationship between the midgut and entire body microbiota of Aedes is unclear. In this study, we collected mosquito samples reared under the same laboratory conditions and compared the microbial composition of midgut and entire bodies of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.METHODS: In this study, we collected mosquito samples reared under the same laboratory conditions and compared the microbial composition of midgut and entire bodies of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.RESULTS: A total of 341 OTUs were identified, showing that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum and Methylobacterium the dominant genus in both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The bacterial diversity and community structures of the entire bodies were similar between males and females in both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Conversely, the bacterial compositions of male and female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were significantly different. NMDS analysis, UPGMA analysis, diversity indices and OTU distribution demonstrated that compositions and structures in midgut microbiota were similar but significantly different in the entire bodies of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Functional prediction analysis showed that metabolism and environmental information processing were the dominant KEGG pathways at level 1. Our study showed that there were significantly different level 2 and 3 KEGG pathways in the midgut microbiota (16 level 2 and 24 level 3) and the entire bodies (33 level 2 and 248 level 3) between female Aedes albopictus and Aedes Aegypti.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings that Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus reared in the same laboratory harbor a similar gut bacterial microbiome but different entire body microbiota imply that the gut microbiota of adult mosquitoes is environmentally determined regardless of the host genotype, but the entire body microbiota is more genetically determined.

As a result, the outcome of plant competition can change with the density of mutualists, with microbe-responsive plant species having high competitive ability when mutualists are abundant and non-responsive plants having high competitive ability with low densities of mutualists. When responsive plant species also allow mutualists to grow to greater densities, changes in mutualist density can generate a positive feedback, reinforcing an initial advantage to either plant type. We study a model of mutualist-mediated competition to understand outcomes of plant-plant interactions within a patchy environment. We find that a microbe-responsive plant can exclude a non-responsive plant from some initial conditions, but it must do so across the landscape including in the microbe-free areas where it is a poorer competitor. Otherwise, the non-responsive plant will persist in both mutualist-free and mutualist-rich regions. We apply our general findings to two different biological scenarios: invasion of a non-responsive plant into an established microbe-responsive native population, and successional replacement of non-responders by microbe-responsive species. We find that resistance to invasion is greatest when seed dispersal by the native plant is modest and dispersal by the invader is greater. Nonetheless, a native plant that relies on microbial mutualists for competitive dominance may be particularly vulnerable to invasion because any disturbance that temporarily reduces its density or that of the mutualist creates a window for a non-responsive invader to establish dominance. We further find that the positive feedbacks from associations with beneficial soil microbes create resistance to successional turnover. Our theoretical results constitute an important first step toward developing a general understanding of the interplay between mutualism and competition in patchy landscapes, and generate qualitative predictions that may be tested in future empirical studies.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22","0","0","0","22","0","22",NA,NA,"","1932-6203",NA,"MEDLINE:25946068","25946068",NA

Moreover, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of EM6PR transcripts in 9 out of the 10 PCR positive plants.

Although single genes have been important in engineering herbicide and pest tolerance traits in crops, future improvements of complex traits like yield and nutritional quality will likely require the introduction of multiple genes. This research reports a system (GAANTRY; Gene Assembly in Agrobacterium by Nucleic acid Transfer using Recombinase technologY) for the flexible, invivo stacking of multiple genes within an Agrobacterium virulence plasmid Transfer-DNA (T-DNA). The GAANTRY system utilizes invivo transient expression of unidirectional site-specific recombinases and an alternating selection scheme to sequentially assemble multiple genes into a single transformation construct. To demonstrate GAANTRY's capabilities, 10 cargo sequences were sequentially stacked together to produce a 28.5-kbp T-DNA, which was used to generate hundreds of transgenic events. Approximately 90% of the events identified using a dual antibiotic selection screen exhibited all of the introduced traits. A total of 68% of the tested lines carried a single copy of the selection marker transgene located near the T-DNA left border, and only 8% contained sequence from outside the T-DNA. The GAANTRY system can be modified to easily accommodate any method of DNA assembly and generate high-quality transgenic plants, making it a powerful, yet simple to use tool for plant genetic engineering.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"32","1","1","0","26","1","35",NA,NA,"","1365-313X",NA,"MEDLINE:29901840","29901840",NA

Gateway cloning strategy was adopted for isolation of HsfA1d from Arabidopsis thaliana and cloning into plant expression vector. The target gene was introduced into potato by infecting internodal explants with Agrobacterium strain GV3101 carrying pGWB402Omega-HsfA1d construct. Upon exposure to heat stress, the wild-type plants turned yellowish, whereas no phenotypic effect on transgenic plants was observed. Expression of HsfA1d in transgenic plants was increased by 5.8-fold under thermal stress compared to room temperature. Transgenic plants exhibited 6-fold increase in the expression of downstream HSP70 under thermal stress compared to wild-type plants. Both chlorophyll a and b were significantly decreased in wild-type plants while no such decrease was recorded in transgenic plants under thermal stress. Heat stress was found to have no significant effect on carotenoid pigments of both wild-type and transgenic plants. Significantly lower electrolyte leakage from transgenic plants was witnessed compared to wild type upon exposure to thermal stress. Transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher proline content compared to wild-type plants under heat stress.

Herein, we developed a new one-step protocol for transgenic soybean recovery by combining the two different transformation methods. This protocol comprises the following steps: agrobacterial preparation, seed sterilization, soybean embryo excision, shoot-cell injury by tungsten-microparticle bombardment, A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, embryo co-cultivation in vitro, and selection of transgenic plants. This protocol can be completed in approximately 30-40 weeks. The average efficiency of producing transgenic soybean germlines using this protocol was 9.84%, similar to other previously described protocols. However, we introduced a more cost-effective, more straightforward and shorter methodology for transgenic plant recovery, which allows co-cultivation and plant regeneration in a single step, decreasing the chances of contamination and making the manipulation easier. Finally, as a hallmark, our protocol does not generate plant chimeras, in contrast to traditional plant regeneration protocols applied in other Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods.

The study evaluated the effect of Africa Biofortified Sorghum (ABS) genes from ABS event 188 on the vegetative and reproductive features of the F2 populations derived from crosses with Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii. Results: F1 populations were obtained from reciprocal crosses involving ABS event 188 and its null segregant with inbred weedy parents from S. bicolor subsp. drummondii. Four F2 populations and four parental populations were raised in RCBD with 4 replications in a confined field plot for two seasons. Vegetative and reproductive traits were evaluated. The vigour shown in the F2 populations from the reciprocal crosses involving ABS event 188 and S. bicolor subsp. drummondii was similar to that in the crosses involving the null segregant and S. bicolor subsp. drummondii. Differences in vegetative and reproductive parameters were observed between the parental controls and the F2 populations. Examination of the above and below ground vegetative biomass showed lack of novel weedy related features like rhizomes. Conclusions: Therefore, release of crops with ABS 188 transgenes into cropping systems is not likely to pose a risk of conferring additional adaptive advantage in the introgressing populations. The interaction of ABS genes in weedy backgrounds will also not have an effect towards enhancing the weedy features in these populations.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","2","0","4",NA,NA,"0717-3458","",NA,"SCIELO:S0717-34582016000400008",NA,NA

In order to develop capacity for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the tropical staple cassava (Manihot esculenta), the Phytoene desaturase (MePDS) gene was targeted in two cultivars using constructs carrying gRNAs targeting two sequences within MePDS exon 13. After Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into cassava cells, both constructs induced visible albino phenotypes within cotyledon-stage somatic embryos regenerating on selection medium and the plants regenerated therefrom. A total of 58 (cv. 60444) and 25 (cv. TME 204) plant lines were recovered, of which 38 plant lines (19 from each cultivar) were analyzed for mutagenesis. The frequency of plant lines showing albino phenotype was high, ranging from 90 to 100% in cv. TME 204. Observed albino phenotypes were comprised of full albinos devoid of green tissue and chimeras containing a mixture of white and green tissues. Sequence analysis revealed that 38/38 (100%) of the plant lines examined carried mutations at the targeted MePDS site, with insertions, deletions, and substitutions recorded. One putatively mono-allelic homozygous line (1/19) was found from cv. 60444, while 1 (1/19) and 4 (4/19) putatively bi-allelic homozygous lines were found in 60444 and TME204, respectively. The remaining plant lines, comprised mostly of the chimeras, were found to be putatively heterozygous. We observed minor (1 bp) nucleotide substitutions and or deletions upstream of the 5' and or downstream of the 3' targeted MePDS region. The data reported demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of cassava is highly efficient and relatively simple, generating multi-allelic mutations in both cultivars studied. Modification of MePDS described here generates visually detectable mutated events in a relatively short time frame of 6-8 weeks, and does not require sequencing to confirm editing at the target. It therefore provides a valuable platform to facilitate rapid assessment and optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome-editing technologies in cassava.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"79","8","1","0","62","0","85",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:29093724","29093724",NA

In this study, the transgenic construct pBI121-35S-CoOMT-cmyc-Kdel was designed successfully.METHODS AND RESULTS: The real-time RT-PCR results proved that the CoOMT transgene was successfully introduced into Nicotiana tabacum L. plants and produced mRNA. Its transcription levels in three transgenic tobacco lines, T0-7, T0-9, and T0-20, in the T0 generation were higher than those in wild-type tobacco plants. By analysing Western blots and ELISAs, three T0 generation transgenic tobacco lines also expressed recombinant CoOMT (rCoOMT) protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40kDa, and its contents ranged from 0.048mugmg-1 to 0.177mugmg-1. These data illustrated that the CoOMT transgene was expressed; thus, the rCoOMT protein synthesis efficiency increased significantly in comparison with that of the wild-type tobacco plants. The total alkaloid contents ranged from 2.12g100g-1 (of dry weight) to 3.88g100g-1 (of dry weight). The T0-20 plant had the highest total alkaloid content (3.88g100g-1 of dry weight), followed by the T0-7 line (2.75g100g-1 of dry weight). The total alkaloid contents of the CoOMT transgenic tobacco lines increased by approximately 1.09-1.83-fold compared to the wild-type tobacco plants.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the transformation and expression of the CoOMT gene in N. tabacum plants.

Blood was shown to be more suitable for detection of Babesia cf. microti, whilst the spleen tissue was better for detection of H. canis than blood. Moreover, extremely low genetic variability of H. canis and its relatively low prevalence rate observed in this study may suggest that the parasite has only recently been introduced in the sampled area.

Drought and salinity are major abiotic stressors which negatively impact cotton yield under field conditions. Here, a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter gene, K2-NhaD, was introduced into upland cotton R15 using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system. Homozygous transgenic lines K9, K17, and K22 were identified by PCR and glyphosate-resistance. TAIL-PCR confirmed that T-DNA carrying the K2-NhaD gene in transgenic lines K9, K17and K22 was inserted into chromosome 3, 19and 12 of the cotton genome, respectively. Overexpression of K2-NhaD in transgenic cotton plants grown in greenhouse conditions and subjected to drought and salinity stress resulted in significantly higher relative water content, chlorophyll, soluble sugar, proline levels, and SOD, CAT, and POD activity, relative to non-transgenic plants. The expression of stress-related genes was significantly upregulated, and this resulted in improved regulation of metabolic pathways, such as the salt overly sensitive pathway. K2-NhaD transgenic plants growing under field conditions displayed strong salinity and drought tolerance, especially at high levels of soil salinity and drought.

However, in vitro data is not available about its activity against commonly isolated bacteria in this country.METHODOLOGY: The analysis included clinical isolates, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs), representing 124 Escherichia coli, 75 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, identified using the MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for C/T was determined by the Etest (Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi, Italy). In addition, the disk diffusion (DD) test was used to determine the activity of C/T and of the antimicrobials routinely used to test for such pathogens.RESULTS: The C/T activity against the ESBL producers E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were similar (MIC90 value of 1 and 1.5 g/mL, respectively; susceptibility of 100% and 96%, respectively). However, the activity of C/T against the E. coli and K. pneumoniae MDR isolates was much lower (MIC90 value of 256 and 96 g/mL, respectively; susceptibility of 54% for each). The C/T MIC90 value for the non-MDR P. aeruginosa isolates was 3 g/mL and ≥ 256 g/mL for the MDR P. aeruginosa isolates (susceptibility of 96% vs 42% respectively). Overall, the C/T activities show comparable or higher susceptibility to the routinely used antimicrobials.CONCLUSION: The high in vitro activity of C/T points out its value as a possible alternative to the antimicrobials currently used for treatment of infections caused by such pathogens and would help in minimizing toxicity and bacterial resistance.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","3","0","4",NA,NA,"","1972-2680",NA,"MEDLINE:32683345","32683345",NA

Previous studies showed that the two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) play an important role in the intracellular survival of Brucella. To investigate if TCSs involve in the virulence and cytotoxicity of Brucella melitensis, we introduced a mutation into one of the TCSs in chromosome II in Br. melitensis 16M strain, and generated 16MDeltaTceSR, a mutant of Br. melitensis 16M strain. In vitro infection experiments using murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) showed that the survival of 16MDeltaTceSR mutant in macrophages decreased 0·91-log compared with that of wild type Br. melitensis 16M strain at 2 h postinfection, replication of 16MDeltaTceSR mutant in macrophages was 5·65-log, which was much lower than that wild type strain. Results of lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assays in macrophages demonstrated high dose infection with wide type strain produced high level cytotoxicity to macrophages, but 16MDeltaTceSR mutant had very low level cytotoxicity, indicating mutation of TCSs impaired the cytotoxicity of Br. melitensis to macrophages. Animal experiments showed that the spleen colonization of 16MDeltaTceSR was significantly reduced compared with its wild type strains. The lower levels of survival of 16MDeltaTceSR in various stress conditions suggested that the mutation of the TCSs of Br. melitensis was the causative factor of its reduced resistance to stress conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrated TCS TceSR involves in the intracellular survival, virulence and cytotoxicity of Br. melitensis during its infection. Significance and impact of the study: Two-component systems (TCSs) are predominant bacterial signal transduction mechanisms. The pathogenicity of Brucella is due to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment including low levels of acidic pH, high-salt and heat shock. TCSs are designed to sense diverse stimuli, transfer signals and enact an appropriate adaptive physiological response. Here, we show that Br. meilitensis TCS TceSR is not only involved in regulation of Br. meilitensis virulence and adaptation of environmental stresses, but also can regulate cytotoxicity in macrophages.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","3","0","0","3","0","7",NA,NA,"","1472-765X",NA,"MEDLINE:25721466","25721466",NA

Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a starchy root crop used for human consumption as a staple food and industrial applications. Starch is synthesized by various isoforms of several enzymes. However, the function of starch branching enzymes (SBEs) in starch biosynthesis and mechanisms of starch regulation in cassava have not been understood well. In this study, we aimed to suppress the expression of SBEs in cassava to generate starches with a range of distinct properties, in addition to verifying the functional characteristics of the SBEs. One SBE1, two SBE2, and one SBE3 genes were classified by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed tissue-specific expression of SBE genes in the tuberous roots and leaves of cassava. We introduced RNAi constructs containing fragments of SBE1, SBE2, or both genes into cassava by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and assessed enzymatic activity of SBE using tuberous roots and leaves from these transgenic plants. Simultaneous suppression of SBE1 and SBE2 rendered an extreme starch phenotype compared to suppression of SBE2 alone. Degree of polymerization of 6-13 chains in amylopectin was markedly reduced by suppression of both SBE1 and SBE2 in comparison to the SBE2 suppression; however, no change in chain-length profiles was observed in the SBE1 suppression alone. The role of SBE1 and SBE2 may have functional overlap in the storage tissue of cassava. Simultaneous suppression of SBE1 and SBE2 resulted in highly resistant starch with increased apparent amylose content compared to suppression of SBE2 alone. This study provides valuable information for understanding starch biosynthesis and suggests targets for altering starch quality.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","0","0","1",NA,NA,"","1573-5028",NA,"MEDLINE:34767147","34767147",NA

The lettuce-derived IgA completely protected Vero cells from Stx1. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is thought to control mucosal infections and thus it may be applicable to oral passive immunotherapy. Edible plants are candidate hosts for producing oral formulations with SIgA against pathogenic agents. We previously established a recombinant IgA specific for the B subunit of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1B) consisting of the Fab fragment of Stx1B-specific monoclonal IgG and the Fc region of IgA (hyIgA). Here, we developed transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa) that produces hyIgA in a secretory form (S-hyIgA). An Arabidopsis-derived light-harvesting complex II (LHCB) promoter was used for the expression of all four transgenes (hyIgA heavy, light and j chains, and secretory component). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out to introduce genes into lettuce leaf discs by means of a single vector harboring all four transgenes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of the LHCB promoter, the expression of hyIgA transgenes was observed in leaf and stem tissues, which contain chloroplasts, at the mRNA and protein levels. The leaves produced hyIgA in a more than tenfold higher yield as compared with stems. The lettuce-derived S-hyIgA was found to bind to Stx1B in a dose-dependent manner by means of ELISA. A leaf extract of the transgenic lettuce completely neutralized the cytotoxicity of Stx1 against Vero cells, which are highly susceptible to Stx1. In conclusion, we established a transgenic lettuce producing a secretory form of hyIgA that can bind bacterial toxin. The results indicate that edible practical plants containing S-hyIgA will provide a possible means for immunotherapy for food poisoning.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5","0","0","0","5","0","5",NA,NA,"","1432-2048",NA,"MEDLINE:31222495","31222495",NA

HLB is associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas), a phloem-limited bacterium vectored by Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP). African Citrus Greening, associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter africanus' (CLaf) and its vector the African Citrus Triozid, Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera: Triozidae), are endemic to Africa, although not previously reported from Angola. African Greening is less severe than HLB, largely due to heat sensitivity of CLaf and its vector. Introduction of HLB into southern Africa would be devastating to citrus production in commercial and informal sectors. Concern was raised that CLas or ACP might hae inadvertently been introduced into Angola. In July 2019, a survey was conducted in two citrus nurseries in Luanda and Caxito and in different orchards on 7 farms surrounding Calulo and Quibala. Yellow sticky traps for insects were placed at the various localities and collected after c. 3 weeks. Breeding signs of T. erytreae (pit galls) were observed on citrus in some locations, but no insect vectors were detected on traps. Trees were inspected for signs and symptoms of citrus pests and diseases, particularly those that resemble HLB (foliar blotchy mottle, shoot chlorosis, vein yellowing and corking, lopsided fruit with aborted seeds and colour inversion) and its vectors (pit galls on leaves or waxy exudates). Leaves and shoots with suspect symptoms were sampled for laboratory analysis (43 samples). DNA was extracted from petiole and midrib tissue of leaves using a modified CTAB extraction protocol of Doyle and Doyle (1990). Real-time PCR was done using universal Liberibacter primers of Roberts et al. (2015), CLaf specific primers of Li et al. (2006) and CLas specific primers of Bao et al. (2019). All real-time PCR protocols indicated the presence of CLaf in 6 samples (Tab. S1). CLas or other citrus Liberibacter species were not detected. The presence of CLaf in sample 37 was confirmed by constructing a library (NEXTFLEX DNA Sequencing Kit, PerkinElmer) with extracted DNA and performing high-throughput sequencing on an Ion Torrent S5 platform (Central Analytical Facility, Stellenbosch University). To improve the quality of the reads, all 233,617,700 obtained reads were trimmed from the 3' end to a maximum length of 240 nt using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014). The high quality reads were mapped to the Citrus sinensis reference genome (NC_023046.1) using Bowtie 2.3.4 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) to subtract all the reads that had high identity to the host plant (number of mismatches allowed in the seed was set to 1). The 14,691,369 unmapped reads (6.2% of original data) were mapped to the CLaf reference genome NZ_CP004021.1 using CLC Genomics Workbench 10.1.1 (Qiagen) (Length fraction = 0.8; Similarity fraction = 0.9). A CLaf consensus genome was generated that spanned 99.7% of the reference genome and the 163001 mapped reads had a 22.9 mean read coverage. The consensus sequence was 99.7% identical to NZ_CP004021.1 and was submitted to Genbank as accession: CP054879. The positive CLaf detections were from trees with typical HLB or African Citrus Greening symptoms, viz. lopsided fruit with green stylar ends, aborted seed and stained columella at base of fruit button; yellow shoots with leaves showing symptoms of blotchy mottle and vein yellowing and corking (Fig. S1) in a commercial citrus farm outside Calulo and included 2 'Ponkan' mandarin (C. reticulata), 2 Valencia and 1 'Navelina' tree (C. sinensis), and a citrus nursery in Luanda (1 lime tree; C. aurantifolia) (Tab. S1). This first report of CLaf in Angola highlights the need to prevent spread by removing infected trees and managing the insect vector, as well as the need for further surveys to determine the occurrence of African Greening and its vectors in other provinces and to confirm the absence of exotic citrus pests and diseases.

Human ATR is homologous to bacterial ATR and B cells produce anti-ATR antibodies as an autoimmune response thereby reducing the concentration of ATR and thus limiting production of AdoCbl, one of the two bioactive forms of vitamin B12. The next step in MS pathogenesis is a period of subclinical AdoCbl deficiency over a period of many years resulting in production of odd-carbon-number fatty acids that are incorporated into myelin rendering it antigenic. The next step in MS pathogenesis is breach of the blood brain barrier thereby introducing leukocytes into the brain's blood supply resulting in T cell attack of antigenic myelin. All epidemiological clusters are regions wherein the major agricultural products are legumes that produce a high percentage of odd-carbon-number fatty acids and contain symbiotic rhizobia type bacteria in root nodules and in the soil.

The oleaginous (oil-producing) yeast Lipomyces starkeyi is the subject of active research regarding the production of triacylglycerides as hydrocarbon fuel precursors using a variety of carbohydrate and nutrient sources. The genome of L. starkeyi has been published, which opens the door to production strain improvements through the development and use of the tools of synthetic biology for this oleaginous species. The first step in establishment of synthetic biology tools for an organism is the development of effective and reliable transformation methods with suitable selectable marker genes and demonstration of the utility of the genetic elements needed for expression of introduced genes or deletion of endogenous genes. Chemical-based methods of transformation have been published but suffer from low efficiency. To address these problems, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was investigated as an alternative method for L. starkeyi and other Lipomyces species. In this study, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was demonstrated to be effective in the transformation of both L. starkeyi and other Lipomyces species. The deletion of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 10 gene was also demonstrated in L. starkeyi. In addition to the bacterial antibiotic selection marker gene hygromycin B phosphotransferase, the bacterial beta-glucuronidase reporter gene under the control of L. starkeyi translation elongation factor 1alpha promoter was also stably expressed in six different Lipomyces species.

As we reach the limits of expanding arable land, the responsibility of meeting this production goal will rely on increasing yields. Traditional plant breeding practices will not be able to realistically meet these expectations, thrusting plant biotechnology into the limelight to fulfill these needs. Better varieties will need to be developed faster and with the least amount of regulatory hurdles. With the need to add, delete, and substitute genes into existing genomes, the field of genome editing and gene targeting is now rapidly developing with numerous new technologies coming to the forefront. Agrobacterium-mediated crop transformation has been the most utilized method to generate transgenic varieties that are better yielding, have new traits, and are disease and pathogen resistant. Genome-editing technologies rely on the creation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genomic DNA of target species to facilitate gene disruption, addition, or replacement through either non-homologous end joining or homology-dependent repair mechanisms. DSBs can be introduced through the use of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), or clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas nucleases, among others. Agrobacterium strains have been employed to deliver the reagents for genome editing to the specific target cells. Understanding the biology of transformation from the perspective not only of Agrobacterium, but also of the host, from processing of T-DNA to its integration in the host genome, has resulted in a wealth of information that has been used to engineer Agrobacterium strains having increased virulence. As more technologies are being developed, that will help overcome issues of Agrobacterium host range and random integration of DNA, combined with highly sequence-specific nucleases, a robust crop genome-editing toolkit finally seems attainable.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10","0","0","0","7","0","10",NA,NA,"0070-217X","",NA,"MEDLINE:30043343","30043343",NA

GS3.1 encodes a MATE (multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion) transporter that regulates grain size by directing the transport of p-coumaric acid from the p-coumaric acid biosynthetic metabolon to the flavonoid biosynthetic metabolon. A natural allele of GS3.1 was identified from an African rice with enlarged grains, reduced flavonoid content and increased lignin content in the panicles.

This study details a protocol for the injection of maize seedlings near meristematic tissue with Agrobacterium carrying a viral vector. Recombinant foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) clones engineered for gene silencing and gene expression were used to optimize this method, and its use was expanded to include a recombinant sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) engineered for gene expression. Gene fragments or coding sequences of interest are inserted into a modified, infectious viral genome that has been cloned into the binary T-DNA plasmid vector pCAMBIA1380. The resulting plasmid constructs are transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Maize seedlings as young as 4 days old can be injected near the coleoptilar node with bacteria resuspended in MgSO4 solution. During infection with Agrobacterium, the T-DNA carrying the viral genome is transferred to maize cells, allowing for the transcription of the viral RNA genome. As the recombinant virus replicates and systemically spreads throughout the plant, viral symptoms and phenotypic changes resulting from the silencing of the target genes lesion mimic 22 (les22)orphytoene desaturase (pds) can be observed on the leaves, or expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be detected upon illumination with UV light or fluorescence microscopy. To detect the virus and assess the integrity of the insert simultaneously, RNA is extracted from the leaves of the injected plant and RT-PCR is conducted using primers flanking the multiple cloning site (MCS) carrying the inserted sequence. This protocol has been used effectively in several maize genotypes and can readily be expanded to other viral vectors, thereby offering an accessible tool for viral vector introduction in maize.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","1","0","1",NA,NA,"","1940-087X",NA,"MEDLINE:33720142","33720142",NA

Seventy non-indigenous rodents were trapped [Mus musculus (52), Rattus rattus (17) and Rattus norvegicus (1)], euthanized and sampled on four properties adjacent to the WNP in July 2012.

Few attempts have been made to analyze the ecological aspects that influence pathogen infection in small mammals in livestock production systems. We describe the infection of small mammals with Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., Trichinella spp. and Cysticercus fasciolaris and assess the related intrinsic and extrinsic factors in livestock production systems in central Argentina at the small mammal community, population and individual levels.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten pig farms and eight dairy farms were studied by removal trapping of small mammals from 2008 to 2011. Each farm was sampled seasonally over the course of one year with cage and Sherman live traps. The 505 small mammals captured (14,359 trap-nights) included three introduced murine rodents, four native rodents and two opossums. Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp. antibodies and Trichinella spp. were found in the three murine rodents and both opossums. Rattus norvegicus was also infected with C. fasciolaris; Akodon azarae and Oligoryzomys flavescens with Leptospira spp.; anti-Brucella spp. antibodies were found in A. azarae. Two or more pathogens occurred simultaneously on 89% of the farms, and each pathogen was found on at least 50% of the farms. Pathogen infections increased with host abundance. Infection by Leptospira spp. also increased with precipitation and during warm seasons. The occurrence of anti-Brucella spp. antibodies was higher on dairy farms and during the winter and summer. The host abundances limit values, from which farms are expected to be free of the studied pathogens, are reported.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Murine rodents maintain pathogens within farms, whereas other native species are likely dispersing pathogens among farms. Hence, we recommend preventing and controlling murines in farm dwellings and isolating farms from their surroundings to avoid contact with other wild mammals.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"17","0","0","0","14","1","19",NA,NA,"","1935-2735",NA,"MEDLINE:28665952","28665952",NA

Introducing desirable traits into this valuable plant by the conventional breeding has so far been faced with some restrictions due to the limited gene pool and cross-incompatibility. Therefore, breeders have decided to exploit Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods in order to satisfy the growing market demands. However, more efficient in vitro regeneration protocols are required for this approach.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to develop an efficient protocol for an in vitro plant regeneration by the examining the effects of various combinations and concentrations of the plant growth regulators (PGRs) and different explants types.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaf and petiole explants of the Chrysanthemum morifolium cv. 'Resomee Splendid' were collected from the in vitro grown plantlets. Murashige and Skooge (MS) medium was supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of benzylaminopurine (BAP), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and thidiazuron (TDZ). Thereafter, the effects of these hormonal treatments were investigated on shoot initiation percentage, the average number of shoots per explants, callogenesis, and the type of organogenesis in regard to both types of the explants.RESULTS: Shoots were directly formed from leaf explants on the media that only contained BAP without callus formation. Amongst the other hormonal treatments, a combination of 4.5 mg.L-1 BAP plus 1 mg.L-1 NAA resulted in the direct organogenesis from the leaf explants, which was superior to the other combinations and concentrations. In regard to the petiole explants, direct shoot formation occurred in all the media except for the ones which were fortified with TDZ. In this case, considering the shoot initiation percentage and the mean shoot number per explants, the best results were achieved in the medium supplemented with 1.5 mg.L-1 BAP and 1 mg.L-1 NAA. Results showed that interaction of either BAP or TDZ with NAA was necessary for the callus induction.CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in shoot initiation percentage and the average number of shoots per explants were observed both in leaves and petioles grown on different media. Moreover, the callogenesis rates, as well as organogenesis types, showed some differences among the studied explants when compared on the same media.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4","0","0","0","5","0","5",NA,NA,"1728-3043","",NA,"MEDLINE:30805383","30805383",NA

Objectives: Transformation of the rice tlp into canola via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of the expressed TLP in the transgenic events on the S. sclerotiorum growth was subject to investigation. Materials and methods: The canola (R line Hyola308) was used for transformation experiment. The vector, pBITLPRA1, was used for the stable transformation. The PCR and southern blotting techniques were used to confirm transgene's presence in the transgenic canola events. Antifungal activity of transgenic plants was evaluated by the radial diffusion and spore germination assays. T2 transgenic plants were evaluated by the intact leaf inoculation method in greenhouse assay. Results: In this study, pBITLPRA1 construct containing tlp gene was introduced into canola and the transformed plants were verified by PCR. The glucanase activity of tlp gene in T0 generation was measured and transgenic plants with high activity were assessed by Southern blot analysis to confirm the copy number of the gene. Also, antifungal activity of the single copy T0 transgenic plants against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was evaluated by radial diffusion and spore germination assays. In greenhouse assay, evaluation of T2 transgenic plants by the intact leaf inoculation method demonstrated that following the infection with S. sclerotiorum, there was a significant reduction in the lesion's diameter in transgenic lines compared to the non-transgenic ones. Conclusions: These results revealed that expression of TLP has an inhibitory effect against fungus compared to non-transgenic plants both in vitro and in vivo (i.e., greenhouse condition). These transgenic lines could be used as the additional sources of disease resistance for canola breeding program.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9","1","0","0","7","0","10",NA,NA,"1728-3043","",NA,"MEDLINE:29845070","29845070",NA

AGO1 strongly enhanced potato virus A (PVA) particle production and benefited the infection when supplied in excess. We subsequently identified the potyviral silencing suppressor, helper-component protease (HCPro), as the recruiter of host AGO1. After the identification of a conserved AGO1-binding GW/WG motif in potyviral HCPros, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a tryptophan-to-alanine change into the HCPro (HCProAG) of PVA (PVAAG) and turnip mosaic virus (TuMVAG). AGO1 co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation with PVA HCPro was significantly reduced by the mutation suggesting the interaction was compromised. Although the mutation did not interfere with HCPro's complementation or silencing suppression capacity, it nevertheless impaired virus particle accumulation and the systemic spread of both PVA and TuMV. Furthermore, we found that the HCPro-AGO1 interaction was important for AGO1's association with the PVA coat protein. The coat protein was also more stable in wild type PVA infection than in PVAAG infection. Based on these findings we suggest that potyviral HCPro recruits host AGO1 through its WG motif and engages AGO1 in the production of stable virus particles, which are required for an efficient systemic infection.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12","0","0","0","12","0","12",NA,NA,"","1553-7374",NA,"MEDLINE:33031436","33031436",NA

However, terrestrial plants often suffer from iron deficiency in alkaline soil due to its extremely low solubility. Alkaline soil accounts for about 30% of all cultivated ground in the world. Plants have evolved two distinct strategies, I and II, for iron uptake from the soil. Dicots and non-graminaceous monocots use Strategy I, which is primarily based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) and the uptake of iron(II) by the iron-regulated transporter, IRT1. In contrast, graminaceous plants use Strategy II to efficiently acquire insoluble iron(III). Strategy II comprises the synthesis and secretion of iron-chelating phytosiderophores, such as mugineic acids and the Yellow Stripe 1 transporter proteins of the iron(III)-phytosiderophore complex. Barley, which exhibits the highest tolerance to iron deficiency in alkaline soil among graminaceous plants, utilizes mugineic acids and the specific iron(III)-mugineic acids transporter, HvYS1. In this study, we established the transgenic plant Petunia hybrida, which originally had only Strategy I, by introducing the HvYS1 transporter gene derived from barley. When the transgenic plants were grown hydroponically in media containing the iron(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complex, free 2'-deoxymugineic acid and its iron(III) complex were detected in the root extract of the transgenic plant by electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The growth of the transgenic petunia was significantly better than that of the control host in alkaline conditions. Consequently, the transgenic plant acquired a significantly enhanced tolerance to alkaline hydroponic media in the presence of the iron(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complex.

Here, we describe an efficient gene editing strategy for hybrid poplar, (Populus tremula * alba INRA clone 717-1B4) based on the Golden Gate MoClo cloning. To test the system efficiency for generating single gene mutants, two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and incorporated into the MoClo Tool Kit level 2 binary vector with the Cas9 expression cassette to mutate the SHORT ROOT (SHR) gene. Moreover, we also tested its efficiency for introducing mutations in two genes simultaneously by expressing one sgRNA targeting a single site of the YUC4 gene and the other sgRNA targeting the PLT1 gene. For a robust evaluation of the approach, we repeated the strategy to target the LBD12 and LBD4 genes simultaneously, using an independent construct. We generated hairy roots by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated leaf transformation. Sequencing results confirmed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation in the targeted sites of PtaSHR. Biallelic and homozygous knockout mutations were detected. A deletion spanning both target sites and small insertions/deletions were the most common mutations. Out of the 22 SHR alleles sequenced, 21 were mutated. The phenotype's characterization showed that transgenic roots with biallelic mutations for the SHR gene lacked a defined endodermal single cell layer, suggesting a conserved gene function similar to its homolog in Arabidopsis Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Sequencing results also revealed the high efficiency of the system for generating double mutants. Biallelic mutations for both genes in the yuc4/plt1 and lbd12/lbd4 roots were detected in three (yuc4/plt1) and two (lbd12/lbd4) out of four transgenic roots evaluated. A small deletion or a single nucleotide insertion at the single target site was the most common mutations. This CRISPR/Cas9 strategy arises as a rapid, simple and standardized gene-editing tool to evaluate the gene role in essential developmental programs such as radial cell differentiation of poplar roots.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3","0","0","0","2","0","3",NA,NA,"","1758-4469",NA,"MEDLINE:33960379","33960379",NA

Nicotiana tabacum has emerged as a suitable host for metabolic engineering of terpenoids and derivatives in tall glandular trichomes, which actively synthesize and secrete specialized metabolites. However, implementation of an entire biosynthetic pathway in glandular trichomes requires the identification of trichome-specific promoters to appropriately drive the expression of the transgenes needed to set up the desired pathway. In this context, RT-qPCR analysis was carried out on wild-type N. tabacum plants to compare the expression pattern and gene expression level of NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1, two newly identified genes expressed in glandular trichomes, with those of NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2alpha, NtCPS2, and NtLTP1, which were reported in the literature to be specifically expressed in glandular trichomes. We show that NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1 are specifically expressed in glandular trichomes like NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2alpha, and NtCPS2, while NtLTP1 is also expressed in other leaf tissues as well as in the stem. Transcriptional fusions of each of the six promoters to the GUS-VENUS reporter gene were introduced in N. tabacum by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Almost all transgenic lines displayed GUS activity in tall glandular trichomes, indicating that the appropriate cis regulatory elements were included in the selected promoter regions. However, unlike for the other promoters, no trichome-specific line was obtained for pNtLTP1:GUS-VENUS, in agreement with the RT-qPCR data. These data thus provide two new transcription promoters that could be used in metabolic engineering of glandular trichomes.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"6","0","0","0","4","0","6",NA,NA,"","1432-2048",NA,"MEDLINE:32020353","32020353",NA

The pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is a prominent invasive plant-parasitic nematode and has become a serious worldwide threat to forest ecosystems. Presently, the complete genome sequence of B. xylophilus has been published, and research involving genome-wide functional analyses is likely to increase. In this study, we describe the construction of an effective silencing vector, pDH-RH, which contains a transcriptional unit for a hairpin loop structure. Utilising this vector, double-stranded (ds)RNAs with sequences homologous to the target genes can be expressed in a transformed filamentous fungus via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation technology, and can subsequently induce the knockdown of target gene mRNA expression in B. xylophilus by allowing the nematode to feed on the fungal transformants. Four dumpy genes (Bx-dpy-2, 4, 10 and 11) were used as targets to detect RNAi efficiency. By allowing the nematode to feed on target gene-transformed Fusarium oxysporum strains, target transcripts were knocked down 34-87% compared with those feeding on the wild-type strain as determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Morphological RNAi phenotypes were observed, displaying obviously reduced body length; weak dumpy or small (short and thin) body size; or general abnormalities. Moreover, compensatory regulation and non-specific silencing of dpy genes were found in B. xylophilus. Our results indicate that RNAi delivery by feeding in B. xylophilus is a successful technique. This platform may provide a new opportunity for undertaking RNAi-based, genome-wide gene functional studies in vitro in B. xylophilus. Moreover, as B. xylophilus feeds on endophytic fungi when a host has died, RNAi feeding technology will offer the prospect for developing a novel control strategy for the nematode. Furthermore, this platform may also be applicable to other parasitic nematodes that have a facultative, fungivorous habit.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7","2","0","0","6","0","9",NA,NA,"","1879-0135",NA,"MEDLINE:26953254","26953254",NA

D. citri possesses a vertically transmitted intracellular symbiont, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), which produces diaphorin; a polyketide that is toxic to various eukaryotic organisms. Our previous study demonstrated that the total amount and average concentration of diaphorin in adult D. citri, when homogeneous distribution is assumed within the insect, are sufficient to exert inhibitory effects on fungi and insects, including the Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae); one of the major predators of D. citri. However, diaphorin may be localized to a limited body area within D. citri, and its concentration may change during development. In the present study, to better understand the physiological and ecological function of diaphorin, we assessed the distribution of diaphorin within the D. citri body and analyzed concentrations of diaphorin in various developmental stages. Expression of genes involved in diaphorin synthesis was also analyzed. The results demonstrated that diaphorin is distributed widely in the D. citri body, which appears to be a prerequisite for effective deterrence of natural enemies. The concentration of diaphorin was shown to change significantly during the development of D. citri. It was highest in mature adults, followed by embryos and teneral adults, and lowest in nymphs. The lowest concentrations of diaphorin observed in nymphs are still presumed to be effective in deterring invasive natural enemies, including parasites, parasitoids, and entomopathogenic fungi. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that amounts of transcripts for diaphorin synthesis genes dipP and dipT were at a minimum in embryos, increased during the nymphal period, and reached a maximum level just after adult eclosion. The alteration pattern of the amounts of transcripts for diaphorin synthesis genes appeared to partially disagree with that of the concentration of diaphorin. The present study provides new insights into the function of diaphorin, which is essential for further investigations that aim to improve the efficacy of D. citri biological control.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9","0","0","0","7","0","9",NA,NA,"","1879-1611",NA,"MEDLINE:31442480","31442480",NA

Uncovering the mechanism of how host factors are involved in virus infection could pave the way to defeat viral disease. In this study, we characterized a lipid transfer protein, designated NbLTP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana, which was downregulated after Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) inoculation. BaMV accumulation significantly decreased in NbLTP1-knockdown leaves and protoplasts compared with the controls. The subcellular localization of the NbLTP1-orange fluorescent protein (OFP) was mainly the extracellular matrix. However, when we removed the signal peptide (NbLTP1/DeltaSP-OFP), most of the expressed protein targeted chloroplasts. Both NbLTP1-OFP and NbLTP1/DeltaSP-OFP were localized in chloroplasts when we removed the cell wall. These results suggest that NbLTP1 may have a secondary targeting signal. Transient overexpression of NbLTP1 had no effect on BaMV accumulation, but that of NbLTP1/DeltaSP significantly increased BaMV expression. NbLTP1 may be a positive regulator of BaMV accumulation especially when its expression is associated with chloroplasts, where BaMV replicates. The mutation was introduced to the predicted phosphorylation site to simulate the phosphorylated status, NbLTP/DeltaSP/P(+), which could still assist BaMV accumulation. By contrast, a mutant lacking calmodulin-binding or simulates the phosphorylation-negative status could not support BaMV accumulation. The lipid-binding activity of LTP1 was reported to be associated with calmodulin-binding and phosphorylation, by which the C-terminus functional domain of NbLTP1 may play a critical role in BaMV accumulation.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5","0","0","0","3","0","5",NA,NA,"","1999-4915",NA,"MEDLINE:33261222","33261222",NA

The expression of Nicotiana benthamiana AGO5 gene (NbAGO5) is highly induced by Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we have analyzed the potential promoter activities of NbAGO5 and its interactions with viral proteins by using a 2,000 bp fragment, designated as PN1, upstream to the translation initiation of NbAGO5. PN1 and seven serial 5'-deletion mutants (PN2-PN8) were fused with a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter and introduced into the N. benthamiana genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for further characterization. It was found that PN4-GUS transgenic plants were able to drive strong GUS expression in the whole plant. In the virus infection tests, the GUS activity was strongly induced in PN4-GUS transgenic plants after being challenged with potexviruses. Infiltration of the transgenic plants individually with BaMV coat protein (CP) or triple gene block protein 1 (TGBp1) revealed that only TGBp1 was crucial for inducing the NbAGO5 promoter. To identify the factors responsible for controlling the activity of the NbAGO5 promoter, we employed yeast one-hybrid screening on a transcription factor cDNA library. The result showed that NbNAC42 and NbZFP3 could directly bind the 704 bp promoter regions of NbAGO5. By using overexpressing and virus-induced gene silencing techniques, we found that NbNAC42 and NbZFP3 regulated and downregulated, respectively, the expression of the NbAGO5 gene. Upon virus infection, NbNAC42 played an important role in regulating the expression of NbAGO5. Together, these results provide new insights into the modulation of the defense mechanism of N. benthamiana against viruses. This virus inducible promoter could be an ideal candidate to drive the target gene expression that could improve the anti-virus abilities of crops in the future.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:35812928","35812928",NA

Although all infected trees were destroyed in compliance with a state mandate, citrus industry stakeholder concerns about HLB in California are high. Little is known about the biology of CLas, particularly the California strains, hindering effective HLB management efforts. In this study, next-generation sequencing technology (Illumina MiSeq) was employed to characterize the California CLas strains. Data sets containing >4 billion (Giga) bp of sequence were generated from each CLas sample. Two prophages (P-HHCA1-2 and P-SGCA5-1) were identified by the MiSeq read mapping technique referenced to two known Florida CLas prophage sequences, SC1 and SC2. P-HHCA1-2 was an SC2-like or Type 2 prophage of 38,989 bp in size. P-SGCA5-1 was an SC1-like or Type 1 prophage of 37,487 bp in size. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that P-HHCA1-2 was part of an Asiatic lineage within the Type 2 prophage group. Similarly, P-SGCA5-1 was part of an Asiatic lineage within Type 1 prophage group. The Asiatic relatedness of both P-HHCA1-2 and P-SGCA5-1 was further presented by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis at terL (encoding prophage terminase) that has been established for CLas strain differentiation. The presence of different prophages suggests that the two California CLas strains could have been introduced from different sources. An alternative explanation is that there was a mixed CLas population containing the two types of prophages, and limited sampling in a geographic region may not accurately depict the true CLas diversity. More accurate pathway analysis may be achieved by including more strains collected from the regions.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"25","4","0","0","23","0","28",NA,NA,"0031-949X","",NA,"MEDLINE:28398165","28398165",NA

Here, we report pyruvate-bound crystal structures of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, identifying a previously elusive activator site for the enzyme. We found that the tetrameric enzyme binds two molecules of pyruvate in a planar conformation. Each binding site is located in a crevice between the C-terminal domains of two subunits where they stack via a distinct beta-helix region. Pyruvate interacts with the side chain of Lys-43 and with the peptide backbone of Ser-328 and Gly-329 from both subunits. These structural insights led to the design of two variants with altered regulatory properties. In one variant (K43A), the allosteric effect was absent, whereas in the other (G329D), the introduced Asp mimicked the presence of pyruvate. The latter generated an enzyme that was preactivated and insensitive to further activation by pyruvate. Our study furnishes a deeper understanding of how glycogen biosynthesis is regulated in bacteria and the mechanism by which transgenic plants increased their starch production. These insights will facilitate rational approaches to enzyme engineering for starch production in crops of agricultural interest and will promote further study of allosteric signal transmission and molecular evolution in this important enzyme family.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","0","0","0","7","0","8",NA,NA,"","1083-351X",NA,"MEDLINE:30401744","30401744",NA

In nature, insertion of T-DNA in the plant genome and its subsequent transfer via sexual reproduction has been shown in several species in the genera Nicotiana and Linaria. In these natural examples of horizontal gene transfer from Agrobacterium to plants, the T-DNA donor is assumed to be a mikimopine strain of A. rhizogenes. A sequence homologous to the T-DNA of the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes was found in the genome of untransformed Nicotiana glauca about 30 years ago, and was named cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA). It represents an imperfect inverted repeat and contains homologs of several T-DNA oncogenes (NgrolB, NgrolC, NgORF13, NgORF14) and an opine synthesis gene (Ngmis). A similar cT-DNA has also been found in other species of the genus Nicotiana. These presumably ancient homologs of T-DNA genes are still expressed, indicating that they may play a role in the evolution of these plants. Recently T-DNA has been detected and characterized in Linaria vulgaris and L. dalmatica. In Linaria vulgaris the cT-DNA is present in two copies and organized as a tandem imperfect direct repeat, containing LvORF2, LvORF3, LvORF8, LvrolA, LvrolB, LvrolC, LvORF13, LvORF14, and the Lvmis genes. All L. vulgaris and L. dalmatica plants screened contained the same T-DNA oncogenes and the mis gene. Evidence suggests that there were several independent T-DNA integration events into the genomes of these plant genera.

CAPRRESI benefits from many strengths of the original plasmid recovery method and introduces restriction enzyme digestion to ease DNA ligation reactions (required for chimera assembly). For this protocol, users clone wildtype genes into the same plasmid (pUC18 or pUC19). After the in silico selection of amino acid sequence regions where chimeras should be assembled, users obtain all the synonym DNA sequences that encode them. Ad hoc Perl scripts enable users to determine all synonym DNA sequences. After this step, another Perl script searches for restriction enzyme sites on all synonym DNA sequences. This in silico analysis is also performed using the ampicillin resistance gene (ampR) found on pUC18/19 plasmids. Users design oligonucleotides inside synonym regions to disrupt wildtype and ampR genes by PCR. After obtaining and purifying complementary DNA fragments, restriction enzyme digestion is accomplished. Chimera assembly is achieved by ligating appropriate complementary DNA fragments. pUC18/19 vectors are selected for CAPRRESI because they offer technical advantages, such as small size (2,686 base pairs), high copy number, advantageous sequencing reaction features, and commercial availability. The usage of restriction enzymes for chimera assembly eliminates the need for DNA polymerases yielding blunt-ended products. CAPRRESI is a fast and low-cost method for fusing protein-coding genes.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"","1940-087X",NA,"MEDLINE:28671650","28671650",NA

As genetic transformation of plants via Agrobacterium has become a routine practice among plant biologists, understanding T-DNA integration remains important for several reasons. First, T-DNA is the final step in one of the unique cases of inter-kingdom horizontal gene transfer in nature. Second, understanding T-DNA integration is important for biotechnological applications. For example, better knowledge of this process may help develop methods to transform species that are currently not susceptible to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In addition, regulatory agencies usually require clean and precise transgenic insertion events, whereas transgenic insertions are commonly complex unpredictable structures. Furthermore, whereas T-DNA integration under natural conditions occurs randomly, technology to direct T-DNA to specific sites in the genome is highly desired. A better understanding of T-DNA integration may help develop methods to achieve more desirable results. Finally, gene targeting methods that require a foreign DNA template for precise DNA modifications in plants often utilize Agrobacterium to deliver the DNA template. Better understanding of the fate of T-DNA in the plant nucleus may help utilize T-DNA for more efficient gene targeting. For introducing gene targeting reagents, efficient delivery of T-DNA without ectopic integration would be useful. The following review summarizes current knowledge related to T-DNA integration. Five major open questions related to T-DNA integration are being presented. Finally, different models for T-DNA integration are being discussed, and a revised model is proposed.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9","0","0","0","6","0","9",NA,NA,"0070-217X","",NA,"MEDLINE:29992359","29992359",NA

Simple linear regression of normalized difference spectral indices and partial least square regression (PLSR) were employed to develop predictive models to estimate the measured parameters.

Deletion of the gene cluster disabled fungal ability to produce GAG on germ tubes, mycelia and appressoria. Relative to the wild type strain, null mutant was impaired in topical infection but not injection of insect hosts. We found that GAG production by Metarhizium is partially acetylated and could mediate fungal adherence to hydrophobic insect cuticles, biofilm formation, and penetration of insect cuticles. In particular, it was first confirmed that this exopolymer is responsible for the formation of appressorium mucilage, the essential extracellular matrix formed along with the infection structure differentiation to mediate cell attachment and expression of cuticle degrading enzymes. In contrast to its production during A. fumigatus invasive growth, GAG is not produced on the Metarhizium cells harvested from insect hemocoels; however, the polymer can glue germ tubes into aggregates to form mycelium pellets in liquid culture.

This approach allowed for comprehensive characterisation of T-DNA integration to single-base resolution, while revealing the unanticipated nature of T-DNA integration in the transformant analysed. These reporter gene endophyte strains were able to establish and maintain stable symbiotum with the host. In addition, the same endophyte strain labelled with two different fluorescent proteins were able to cohabit the same plant.

Thus, a full DNA and coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the Pikh gene, 3172 bp, and 1206 bp in length, were obtained through amplifying the gDNA and cDNA template from a PH9-resistant rice variety using a specific primer. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology was also used to introduce the Pikh gene into the MR219 callus. Subsequently, transgenic plants were evaluated from the DNA to protein stages using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), semi-quantitative RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Transgenic plants were also compared with a control using a real-time quantification technique (to quantify the pathogen population), and transgenic and control plants were challenged with the local most virulent M. oryzae pathotype, P7.2. Based on the results, the Pikh gene encodes a hydrophilic protein with 18 sheets, 4 helixes, and 21 coils. This protein contains 401 amino acids, among which the amino acid sequence from 1 to 376 is a non-cytoplasmic region, that from 377 to 397 is a transmembrane region, and that from 398 to 401 is a cytoplasmic region with no identified disordered regions.

The quantity of the amino acid leucine in the transgenic rice plants increased significantly from 17.131 in the wild-type to 47.865 mg g(-1) in transgenic plants. The M. oryzae population was constant at 31, 48, and 72 h after inoculation in transgenic plants, while it was increased in the inoculated control plants.

We provide evidence that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis of two homologous ATP-binding cassette subfamily G (ABCG) genes, ABCG44 (Solyc08g067610) and ABCG45 (Solyc08g067620), in tomato significantly reduces SLs in the root exudate and abolishes germination of the root-parasitic weed P. aegyptiaca. Based on genome sequence similarity between ABCG44 and ABCG45, a 20-bp target sequence in their exon region was selected to design single guide RNA targeting both genes using CRISPR/Cas9. The plant binary vector constructs harboring the specific Cas9 and single guide RNA were transformed into tomato. Selected T0 mutated tomato plants showed different types of deletions at both gene loci. Genotype analysis of T1 plants suggested stable inheritance of the introduced mutations without any potential off-target effects. The phenotype of Cas9-mutated plants included increased shoot branching and growth of axillary buds, and reduced length of primary stems. Interestingly, reduced germination of P. aegyptiaca resulted from a decrease in the SL orobanchol in the root exudate of Cas9-mutated plants; however, orobanchol content in the root extract was unchanged compared to control plants.

Innovative pre-breeding and breeding approaches, such as identifying candidate genes in wild or land races using genomics tools, can pave the way for genetic improvement in oil palm. In this review, we highlighted the modern breeding tools, including genomics, marker-assisted breeding, genetic engineering, and genome editing techniques in oil palm crops, and we explored certain concerns connected to the techniques and their applications in practical breeding.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","0","0","0","0","0","0",NA,NA,"2223-7747","",NA,"MEDLINE:35684168","35684168",NA

Understanding how the vector acquires the pathogen and inoculates new hosts is critical in developing effective management strategies. Management may be an insecticide applied to kill the vector or a host plant resistance mechanism to make the host plant less suitable for the vector. In either case, the tactic must act before the insect performs the key behavior(s) resulting in either acquisition or transmission. This requires knowledge of the timing of behaviors the insect uses to probe the plant and commence ingestion. These behaviors are visualized using electropenetrography (EPG), wherein the plant and insect become part of an electrical circuit. With the tools to define specific steps in the probing process, we can understand the timing of acquisition and inoculation. With that understanding comes the potential for more relevant testing of management strategies, through insecticides or host plant resistance.

Several of these techniques can introduce single nucleotide changes without integrating foreign DNA and thereby generate organisms with intended phenotypes. Consequently, such organisms and products thereof might be indistinguishable from naturally occurring or conventionally bred counterparts with established analytical tools. The modifications can entirely resemble random mutations regardless of being spontaneous or induced chemically or via irradiation.

However, notably varying editing efficiencies, restrictive requirements for protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) and a narrow editing window greatly limit their application. Here, we developed a robust high-efficiency ABE (PhieABE) toolbox for plants by fusing an evolved, highly active form of the adenosine deaminase TadA8e and a single-stranded DNA-binding domain (DBD), based on PAM-less/free Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nickase variants that recognize the PAM NGN (for SpCas9n-NG and SpGn) or NNN (for SpRYn). By targeting 29 representative targets in rice and assessing the results, we demonstrate that PhieABEs have significantly improved base-editing activity, expanded target range and broader editing windows compared to the ABE7.10 and general ABE8e systems. Among these PhieABEs, hyper ABE8e-DBD-SpRYn (hyABE8e-SpRY) showed nearly 100% editing efficiency at some tested sites, with a high proportion of homozygous base substitutions in the editing windows and no single guide RNA (sgRNA)-dependent off-target changes. The original sgRNA was more compatible with PhieABEs than the evolved sgRNA. In conclusion, the DBD fusion effectively promotes base-editing efficiency, and this novel PhieABE toolbox should have wide applications in plant functional genomics and crop improvement.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"6","1","0","0","1","0","7",NA,NA,"","1467-7652",NA,"MEDLINE:34984801","34984801",NA

While their presence is appreciated as game animals, they are also responsible for significant agricultural damage, habitat degradation and water quality issues. In addition, wild boars may harbor ticks and can act as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, thus posing a risk of transmission towards humans and domestic animals. This latter aspect of their veterinary-medical and epidemiological significance has become especially important in recent years, because increasing numbers of wild boars are reported to enter urban areas. Despite of this, reports on tick infestations of wild boars are scarce in Europe. For this study, 333 ixodid ticks were collected from 51 wild boars at 32 peri-urban locations in 14 counties of Hungary, during 2005-2008 (older samples) and 2019-2020 (new samples). Five species of ticks were identified: Dermacentor reticulatus (n=165), Ixodes ricinus (n=90) and Haemaphysalis concinna (n=29) in both sample groups, while H. inermis (n=29) and D. marginatus (n=20) were only found among the old samples. The seasonality of collected ticks corresponded to their known activities. After DNA extraction, ticks were screened for three groups of tick-borne pathogens. All samples were negative for brucellae, recently reported to be carried and transmitted transovarially by D. marginatus. Four D. reticulatus contained Babesia canis DNA, while in one H. concinna nymph the recently discovered zoonotic B. cf. crassa (reported in Slovenia within 80 km of our sampling site) was detected. In addition, Anaplasma phagocytophilum was identified in D. reticulatus (n=1), H. concinna (n=3) and in its known vector, I. ricinus (n=15). Phylogenetically, three out of four A. phagocytophilum genotypes clustered with zoonotic ones. In conclusion, despite of the high prevalence of Brucella suis in wild boars in Hungary, no evidence was found in support of the epidemiological role of ticks in transmitting brucellae. On the other hand, wild boars might introduce B. canis-carrier D. reticulatus into urban areas, unlike birds (which are not known to carry this tick species in the country). Most importantly, tick-infested wild boars can contribute to the spread of a novel zoonotic Babesia sp. and of the zoonotic variants of A. phagocytophilum.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","0","0","1",NA,NA,"","1877-9603",NA,"MEDLINE:35306450","35306450",NA

Observations of extant CGA species suggest the existence of some of the evolutionary adaptations that had to occur for land colonization; however, to date, there has been no robust experimental platform to address this genetically. We present a protocol for high-throughput Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Penium margaritaceum, a unicellular CGA species. The versatility of Penium as a model for studying various aspects of plant cell biology and development was illustrated through non-invasive visualization of protein localization and dynamics in living cells. In addition, the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) for reverse genetic studies was demonstrated by targeting genes associated with cell wall modification (pectin methylesterase) and biosynthesis (cellulose synthase). This provided evidence supporting current models of cell wall assembly and inter-polymer interactions that were based on studies of land plants, but in this case using direct observation in vivo.

We evaluated vector response to phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus trees using virus-induced gene silencing technology. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was used to produce a phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus (CTV-tPDS) that expresses visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues to attract D. citri. We found that D. citri were more attracted to CTV-tPDS plants with noticeably better fecundity and overall population fitness than on control plants. Moreover, rearing D. citri on CTV-tPDS plants significantly increased their survival probability compared with those reared on control plants. CTV-tPDS plants possessed reduced content of both carotenoid and chlorophyll pigments resulting in a consistent photobleached phenotype on citrus leaves which provided a sufficient close-range visual attractant to stimulate D. citri landing. Additionally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which offered adequate olfactory cues to attract psyllid from long-range. Finally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched metabolite content of phloem sap and leaves which offered appropriate gustatory cues that influenced probing/feeding behavior. We believe that introducing CTV-tPDS plants (as a trap crop) to D. citri-infested orchards will attract and congregate psyllids to facilitate their removal from the target crop with insecticides or by other means. This new strategy could be deployed relatively quickly and economically to HLB-impacted citrus industries. Moreover, it is an eco-friendly strategy because it should partially reduce the input of chemical insecticides ameliorating the indirect cost of HLB infection.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","0","0","0","2","0","2",NA,NA,"","1873-2259",NA,"MEDLINE:34034878","34034878",NA

Both have been successfully applied producing trees. The first method avoids the use of any foreign selectable marker genes; only the gene-of-interest is integrated between the T-DNA border sequences. The second method makes use of recombinase-based marker excision. For the first method we used the MdMYB10 gene from a red-fleshed apple coding for a transcription factor involved in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. Red plantlets were obtained and presence of the cisgene was confirmed. Plantlets were grafted and grown in a greenhouse. After 3 years, the first flowers appeared, showing red petals. Pollination led to production of red-fleshed cisgenic apples. The second method used the pM(arker)F(ree) vector system, introducing the scab resistance gene Rvi6, derived from apple. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, followed by selection on kanamycin, produced genetically modified apple lines. Next, leaves from in vitro material were treated to activate the recombinase leading to excision of selection genes. Subsequently, the leaf explants were subjected to negative selection for marker-free plantlets by inducing regeneration on medium containing 5-fluorocytosine. After verification of the marker-free nature, the obtained plants were grafted onto rootstocks. Young trees from four cisgenic lines and one intragenic line, all containing Rvi6, were planted in an orchard. Appropriate controls were incorporated in this trial. We scored scab incidence for three consecutive years on leaves after inoculations with Rvi6-avirulent strains. One cisgenic line and the intragenic line performed as well as the resistant control. In 2014 trees started to overcome their juvenile character and formed flowers and fruits. The first results of scoring scab symptoms on apple fruits were obtained. Apple fruits from susceptible controls showed scab symptoms, while fruits from cisgenic and intragenic lines were free of scab.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"41","1","0","0","30","1","42",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:25964793","25964793",NA

A higher resolution understanding of the incidence of human pathogens on food plants and co-occurring phytobiota using metagenomic approaches (metagenome tracking) may contribute to improved source attribution and risk assessment in cases where human pathogens become introduced to agro-ecologies. Between 1990 and 2007, as many as 1990 culture-confirmed Salmonella illnesses were linked to tomatoes from as many as 12 multistate outbreaks (Bell et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2014; CDC, 2004; CDC, 2007; Greene et al., 2005a; Gruszynski et al., 2014). When possible, source attribution for these incidents revealed a biogeographic trend, most events were associated with eastern growing regions. To improve our understanding of potential biogeographically linked trends in contamination of tomatoes by Salmonella, we profiled microbiota from the surfaces of tomatoes from Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and California. Bacterial profiles from California tomatoes were completely different than those of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina (which were highly similar to each other). A statistically significant enrichment of Firmicutes taxa was observed in California phytobiota compared to the three eastern states. Rhizobiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the most abundant bacterial families associated with tomatoes grown in eastern states. These baseline metagenomic profiles of phyllosphere microbiota may contribute to improved understanding of how certain ecologies provide supportive resources for human pathogens on plants and how components of certain agro-ecologies may play a role in the introduction of human pathogens to plants.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9","0","0","0","9","0","9",NA,NA,"","1095-9998",NA,"MEDLINE:30621868","30621868",NA

Whereas some plants synthesize galactolipids from diacylglycerol assembled in the plastid, others, including rice, derive their galactolipids from diacylglycerols assembled by the eukaryotic pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pDH), coded by SUPPRESSOR OF FATTY ACID DESATURASE 1 (SFD1; alias GLY1) gene, catalyzes the formation of glycerol 3-phosphate (G3p), the backbone of many membrane lipids.

Arabidopsis SFD1 localizes in rice plastids and its over-expression increases plastidic membrane lipid content in transgenic rice plants without any major impact on ER lipids. The results suggest that over-expression of plastidic G3pDH enhances biosynthesis of plastid-localized lipids in rice. Lipid composition in the transgenic plants is consistent with increased phosphatidylglycerol synthesis in the plastid and increased galactolipid synthesis from diacylglycerol produced via the ER pathway.

Regardless of its origin, P. diazotrophica promoted a superior accumulation of plant biomass than other bacterial species.

The identification of genes involved in mechanisms targeted to cope with water shortage is an essential and indispensable task for improving the drought and salt tolerance of soybean. One of the approaches for obtaining lines with increased tolerance is genetic modification. The dehydration-responsive element binding proteins (DREBs), belonging to the AP2 family, are trans-active transcription factors that bind to the cis-sequences of the promoter for activating the expression of the target genes that mediate drought and salt tolerant responses. In this study, the GmDREB6 transgene was introduced into DT84 cultivar soybean plants, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The efficacy of GmDREB6 overexpression in enhancing the transcriptional level of GmP5CS and proline accumulation in genetically modified (GM) soybean plants was also assayed. The results demonstrated that ten GM soybean plants (T0 generation) were successfully generated from the transformed explants after selecting with kanamycin. Among these plantlets, the presence of the GmDREB6 transgene was confirmed in nine plants by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and eight plants showed positive results in Southern blot. In the T1 generation, four GM lines, labelled T1-2, T1-4, T1-7, and T1-10, expressed the recombinant GmDREB6 protein. In the T2 generation, the transcriptional levels of the GmP5CS gene were higher in the GM lines than in the non-transgenic plants, under normal conditions and also under conditions of salt stress and drought, ranging from 1.36 to 2.01 folds and 1.58 to 3.16 folds that of the non-transgenic plants, respectively. The proline content was higher in the four GM soybean lines, T2-2, T2-4, T2-7, and T2-10 than in the non-transgenic plants, ranging from 0.82 mumol/g to 4.03 mumol/g. The proline content was the highest in the GM T2-7 line (7.77 mumol/g). In GM soybean lines, T2-2, T2-4, T2-7, and T2-10 proline content increased after plants were subjected to salt stress for seven days, in comparison to that under normal conditions, and ranged from 247.83% to 300%, while that of the non-GM plants was 238.22%.

Approximately one-fourth of industry raw material has come from wood-based plantations from the 1990s onwards. The greatest development challenge faced by the industry since that time is sourcing robust raw material from agroforestry on private lands. Following genetic improvement of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and realization of its potential as a multiple-use species, it was introduced into India in 1980 under an international cooperation effort with support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). It has since spread across the country as a panacea for rural needs of fuel wood, small timber and cattle forage. The paper industry has found that it has potential as raw material for paper making. One of the largest Indian paper companies is JK Paper Ltd, which has an annual production capacity of 550,000 t/yr with 3 integrated pulp and paper plants located at Songadh (Gujarat), Rayagada (Orissa) and Kagaznagar (Telangana) producing writing and printing paper and virgin packaging boards. This case study describes the leucaena farm forestry plantation program initiated by JK Paper Ltd, Unit CPM (Central Pulp Mills). The unit, under its agroforestry and farm forestry plantation approach, planted leucaena plantations in 2009-2010 in parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh States. To motivate farmers in the mill’s catchment area, and to build confidence in on-farm plantations, exposure visits were arranged to Andhra Pradesh, where huge tracts of agricultural land were under leucaena plantations. As a result, to date, this unit has engaged >7,800 farmers who have established leucaena plantations covering an area of >18,400 ha. A robust plantation R&D network addressed issues such as seed treatment, seed germination, rhizobial inoculation, geometry of plantations, agro-forestry models, selection and development of high production clones, establishment of clonal seed orchards, genetic improvement through mutation techniques and hybridization programs for wood quality improvement.","Resumen India es uno de los principales productores/consumidores de productos de papel y de pulpa de papel (3-4% del total mundial).

El mayor desafío de desarrollo que enfrenta la industria de papel desde esa época es obtener fuentes sólidas de materia prima proveniente de agroforesterías establecidas en tierras privadas. Como consecuencia de las primeras actividades de mejoramiento genético y del reconocimiento de su alto potencial como especie de uso múltiple, se introdujo en 1980 la leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) en India, en el marco de una cooperación con la Agencia Sueca de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, SIDA).

The MLVA (multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis) assay can be helpful to analyse epidemiological correlations among Brucella isolates and to track their geographic origins. To accomplish this task, MLVA-16 was used to analyse the epidemiological links of 63 isolates obtained from dogs and humans. Sixty-three B.canis strains were sorted into three large clusters (A, B and C) and 50 different genotypes (GT1-50), and 43 unique genotypes were represented by single isolates, suggesting that these strains had no obvious epidemiological links and that canine brucellosis is predominantly sporadic in China. The other seven shared genotypes (among a total of 20 isolates) were each represented by two to eight isolates, indicating that strains from each shared genotype were epidemiologically correlated. Five of the shared genotypes were from 16 strains obtained from Beijing, indicating that canine brucellosis in Beijing originates from multipoint outbreaks with multiple sources of infection. Based on comprehensive case analysis of clinical B.canis infection, we preliminarily suggest that human B.canis infections are associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that results in decreased patient immunity. B.canis may have limited epidemiological significance for the healthy population, but it remains a significant threat to the canine breeding industry and to humans who come into close contact with dogs. Based on MLVA-11 data, B.canis strains were clustered into 16 genotypes and divided into five evolutionary branches; these data confirm that this population covers an extensive geographic area and exhibits characteristics of the origin and evolution of co-existing introduced and locally native lineages.

The HN-F gene was cloned downstream of the fatty acid elongase 1 (FAE1) promoter in the binary expression vector, pBI1400-HN-F, and introduced into rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The amount of the HN-F glycoprotein was estimated up to 0.18% and 0.11% of the total soluble protein (TSP) in transgenic seeds and leaves of canola, respectively. Confirmatory analyses of 36 transgenic lines revealed that the HN-F gene was integrated into the genome. Subsequently, HN-F protein could be expressed and accumulated in the seed tissue. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens immunized orally with recombinant HN-F showed a significant rise in specific and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies 35 to 42days post the first administration. The results implied the potential of transgenic canola seed-based expression for oral delivery of NDV immunogenic glycoproteins.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"6","0","0","0","6","0","6",NA,NA,"","1559-0305",NA,"MEDLINE:32246385","32246385",NA

ROS1 and DEL form a pair of well-characterized TFs from Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), which specifically induce anthocyanin accumulation when expressed in tomato fruit. In N. benthamiana, robust induction of a single anthocyanin, delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) was observed after expression of both ROS1 and DEL.

This technology can be used for a variety of genome editing approaches, from gene knockouts and knockins to more specific changes like the introduction of a few nucleotides at a targeted location. Genome editing can be used for a multitude of applications, including the partial functional characterization of genes, the production of transgenic organisms and the development of diagnostic tools. Compared to previously available gene editing strategies, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been shown to be easy to establish in new species and boasts high efficiency and specificity. The primary reason for this is that the editing tool uses an RNA molecule to target the gene or sequence of interest, making target molecule design straightforward, given that standard base pairing rules can be exploited. Similar to other genome editing systems, CRISPR-Cas9-based methods also require efficient and effective transformation protocols as well as access to good quality sequence data for the design of the targeting RNA and DNA molecules. Since the introduction of this system in 2013, it has been used to genetically engineer a variety of model species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. Subsequently, researchers working on non-model species have taken advantage of the system and used it for the study of genes involved in processes as diverse as secondary metabolism in fungi, nematode growth and disease resistance in plants, among many others. This protocol detailed below describes the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing protocol for the truncation of a gene involved in the sexual cycle of Huntiella omanensis, a filamentous ascomycete fungus belonging to the Ceratocystidaceae family.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","0","0","0","1","0","2",NA,NA,"","1940-087X",NA,"MEDLINE:32597846","32597846",NA

The resultant construct was introduced into wheat genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, with four homozygous marker-free transgenic lines (namely GLRW-1, -3, -5 and -8) developed. Aided by the newly published wheat genome sequence, the T-DNA insertion sites in GLRW-3 and GLRW-8 were elucidated at base-pair resolution. While the T-DNA in GLRW-3 inserted in an intergenic region, that of GLRW-8 inactivated an endogenous gene, which was thus excluded from further analysis. Compared to wild -type (WT) control, GLRW-1, -3 and -5 showed decreased LOX gene expression, lower LOX activity and less lipid peroxidation in the grains; they also exhibited significantly higher germination rates and better seedling growth after artificial ageing treatment. Interestingly, the three GLRW lines also had substantially increased contents of several fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid and linolenic acid) in their grain and flour samples than WT control. Collectively, our data suggest that suppression of grain LOX activity can be employed to improve the storability and fatty acid content of wheat seeds and that the MFTID line GLRW-3 is likely of commercial value.

Traditionally, japonica varieties were planted mainly in mid latitudes in the northeast plain and Yangtze River region. The key obstacle for introducing elite mid-latitude japonica varieties to low latitudes is the severe shortening of growth period of the japonica varieties due to their sensitivity to low-latitude short photoperiod and high temperature. Here we report development of new japonica rice with prolonged basic vegetative growth (BVG) periods for low latitudes by targeted editing the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated both frame-shift and/or in-frame deletion mutants in four japonica varieties, Nipponbare, Longdao16, Longdao24, and Xiushui134. When planting at low-latitude stations, the frame-shift homozygous lines exhibited significantly longer BVG periods compared with wild-types. Interestingly, we observed that minor deletion of the first few residues within the receiver domain could quantitatively impair the function of Ehd1 on activation of Hd3a and RFT1, resulting in an intermediate-long BVG period phenotype in the homozygous in-frame deletion ehd1 lines. Field investigation further showed that, both the in-frame and frame-shift lines exhibited significantly improved yield potential compared with wild-types. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to rapid breeding of elite japonica varieties with intermediate-long and long BVG periods for flexible cropping systems in diverse areas or under different seasons in southern China, and other low-latitude regions.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"9","5","0","0","8","0","11",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:32265960","32265960",NA

The three most important soybean producers are Argentina, Brazil, and United States, where soybean crops are routinely inoculated with symbiotic N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium spp. This extended inoculation gave rise to soybean-nodulating allochthonous populations (SNAPs) that compete against new inoculant for nodulation, thus impairing yield responses. Competitiveness depends on intrinsic factors contributed by genotype, extrinsic ones determined by growth and environmental conditions, and strain persistence in the soil. To assess these factors in Argentinean SNAPs, we studied 58 isolates from five sites of the main soybean cropping area. BOX-A1R DNA fingerprint distributed these isolates in 10 clades that paralleled the pHs of their original soils. By contrast, reference Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, including those used as soybean-inoculants, were confined to a single clade. More detailed characterization of a subset of 11 SNAP-isolates revealed that five were Bradyrhizobium japonicum, two Bradyrhizobium elkanii, two Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens), one Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, and one Paenibacillus glycanilyticus-which did not nodulate when inoculated alone, and therefore was excluded from further characterization. The remaining subset of 10 SNAP-isolates was used for deeper characterization. All SNAP-isolates were aluminum- and heat-tolerant, and most of them were glyphosate-tolerant. Meanwhile, inoculant strains tested were sensitive to aluminum and glyphosate. In addition, all SNAP-isolates were motile to different degrees. Only three SNAP-isolates were deficient for N2-fixation, and none was intrinsically more competitive than the inoculant strain. These results are in contrast to the general belief that rhizobia from soil populations evolved as intrinsically more competitive for nodulation and less N2-fixing effective than inoculants strains. Shoot:root ratios, both as dry biomass and as total N, were highly correlated with leaf ureide contents, and therefore may be easy indicators of N2-fixing performance, suggesting that highly effective N2-fixing and well-adapted strains may be readily selected from SNAPs. In addition, intrinsic competitiveness of the inoculants strains seems already optimized against SNAP strains, and therefore our efforts to improve nodules occupation by inoculated strains should focus on the optimization of extrinsic competitiveness factors, such as inoculant formulation and inoculation technology.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"15","0","0","0","10","0","15",NA,NA,"1664-302X","",NA,"MEDLINE:31139173","31139173",NA

The longest survival times of D. citri adults on A. conyzoides, S. nigrum and P. clematidea were 48, 41 and 11days, respectively. On S. nigrum, the survivorship of females was significantly higher than that of males.

The green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was adopted as a useful model organism for studying various physiological systems. Its ability to grow under both photosynthetic and heterotrophic conditions allows efficient growth of non-photosynthetic mutants, making Chlamydomonas a useful genetic tool to study photosynthesis. In addition, this green alga can grow as haploid or diploid cells, similar to yeast, providing a powerful genetic system. As a result, easy and efficient transformation systems have been developed for Chlamydomonas, targeting both the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Since microalgae comprise a rich repertoire of species that offer variable advantages for biotech and biomed industries, gene transfer technologies were further developed for many microalgae to allow for the expression of foreign proteins of interest. Expressing foreign genes in the chloroplast enables the targeting of foreign DNA to specific sites by homologous recombination. Chloroplast transformation also allows for the introduction of genes encoding several enzymes from a complex pathway, possibly as an operon. Expressing foreign proteins in the chloroplast can also be achieved by introducing the target gene into the nuclear genome, with the protein product bearing a targeting signal that directs import of the transgene-product into the chloroplast, like other endogenous chloroplast proteins. Integration of foreign genes into the nuclear genome is mostly random, resulting in large variability between different clones, such that extensive screening is required. The use of different selection modalities is also described, with special emphasis on the use of herbicides and metabolic markers which are considered to be friendly to the environment, as compared to drug-resistance genes that are commonly used. Finally, despite the development of a wide range of transformation tools and approaches, expression of foreign genes in microalgae suffers from low efficiency. Thus, novel tools have appeared in recent years to deal with this problem. Finally, while C. reinhardtii was traditionally used as a model organism for the development of transformation systems and their subsequent improvement, similar technologies can be adapted for other microalgae that may have higher biotechnological value.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"125","0","0","0","108","1","130",NA,NA,"1664-462X","",NA,"MEDLINE:27148328","27148328",NA

Cytochrome P450 71A13 (CYP71A13) is a key enzyme for camalexin biosynthesis and catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) to IAN. The CYP71A13 gene is located in tandem with its close homolog CYP71A12, also encoding an IAOx dehydratase. However, for CYP71A12, indole-3-carbaldehyde and cyanide were identified as major reaction products. To clarify CYP71A12 function in vivo and to better understand IAN metabolism, we generated two cyp71a12 cyp71a13 double knockout mutant lines. CYP71A12-specific transcription activator-like effector nucleases were introduced into the cyp71a13 background, and very efficient somatic mutagenesis was achieved. We observed stable transmission of the cyp71a12 mutation to the following generations, which is a major challenge for targeted mutagenesis in Arabidopsis. In contrast to cyp71a13 plants, in which camalexin accumulation is partially reduced, double mutants synthesized only traces of camalexin, demonstrating that CYP71A12 contributes to camalexin biosynthesis in leaf tissue. A major role of CYP71A12 was identified for the inducible biosynthesis of ICOOH. Specifically, the ICOOH methyl ester was reduced to 12% of the wild-type level in AgNO3-challenged cyp71a12 leaves. In contrast, indole-3-carbaldehyde derivatives apparently are synthesized via alternative pathways, such as the degradation of indole glucosinolates. Based on these results, we present a model for this surprisingly complex metabolic network with multiple IAN sources and channeling of IAOx-derived IAN into camalexin biosynthesis. In conclusion, transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated mutation is a powerful tool for functional analysis of tandem genes in secondary metabolism.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"25","4","0","0","26","0","28",NA,NA,"","1532-2548",NA,"MEDLINE:25953104","25953104",NA

In addition, the immunostimulatory effects of zein have been reported, which are advantageous for vaccine delivery. However, little is known about the interaction between zein PBs and mammalian cells. To better understand this interaction, fluorescent PBs, resulting from the fusion of the N-terminal portion of zein to a green fluorescent protein, was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, recovered by a filtration-based downstream procedure, and used to investigate their internalization efficiency into mammalian cells. We show that fluorescent PBs were efficiently internalized into intestinal epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at a higher rate than polystyrene beads of comparable size. Furthermore, we observed that PBs stimulated cytokine secretion by epithelial cells, a characteristic that may confer vaccine adjuvant activities through the recruitment of APCs.

However, Rev.1 may cause abortions in small ruminants that have been vaccinated during the last trimester of gestation, it is pathogenic to humans, and it induces antibodies directed at the O-polysaccharide (O-PS) of the smooth lipopolysaccharide, thus making it difficult to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals. Rough Brucella strains, which lack O-PS and are considered less pathogenic, have been introduced to address these drawbacks; however, as Rev.1 confers a much better immunity than the rough mutants, it is still considered the reference vaccine for the prophylaxis of brucellosis in small ruminants. Therefore, developing an improved vaccine strain, which lacks the Rev.1 drawbacks, is a highly evaluated task, which requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence attenuation of Rev.1 smooth strains and of natural Rev.1 rough strains, which are currently only partly understood. As the acidification of the Brucella-containing vacuole during the initial stages of infection is crucial for their survival, identifying the genes that contribute to their survival in an acidic environment versus a normal environment will greatly assist our understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms and the attenuated virulence of the Rev.1 strain. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of the smooth and natural rough Rev.1 strains, each grown under either normal or acidic conditions. We found 12 key genes that are significantly downregulated in the Rev.1 rough strains under normal pH, as compared with Rev.1 smooth strains, and six highly important genes that are significantly upregulated in the smooth strains under acidic conditions, as compared with Rev.1 rough strains. All 18 differentially expressed genes are associated with bacterial virulence and survival and may explain the attenuated virulence of the rough Rev.1 strains versus smooth Rev.1 strains, thus providing new insights into the virulence attenuation mechanisms of Brucella.

The emergence of brucellosis in new areas as well as transmission of brucellosis from wild and domestic animals is of great significance in terms of new epidemiological dimensions. Brucellosis poses a major public health threat by the consumption of non-pasteurized milk and milk products produced by unhygienic dairy farms in endemic areas. Regular and meticulous surveillance is essentially required to determine the true picture of brucellosis especially in areas with continuous high prevalence. Additionally, international migration of humans, animals and trade of animal products has created a challenge for disease spread and diagnosis in non-endemic areas. Isolation and identification remain the gold standard test, which requires expertise. The advancement in diagnostic strategies coupled with screening of newly introduced animals is warranted to control the disease. Of note, the diagnostic value of miRNAs for appropriate detection of B. abortus infection has been shown.

Isolates were tested using broth microdilution to determine micafungin MICs. All Candida glabrata isolates and all isolates demonstrating decreased susceptibility to micafungin were screened for FKS mutations using a Luminex assay.Results: In total, 3876 Candida isolates were tested for micafungin resistance, including 832C. glabrata isolates.

Transgenic cottonseeds had ~twofold to threefold increases in the accumulation of total vitamin E (tocopherols+tocotrienols), with more than 60% gamma-tocotrienol. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging showed that gamma-tocotrienol was localized throughout the transgenic embryos.

The genetically programed structure of plant viruses allows them to be modified by genetic engineering, bioconjugation, or encapsulation to form virus nanoparticles (VNPs) that are suitable for a broad range of applications. Plant VNPs can be used to present foreign proteins or epitopes, to construct inorganic hybrid materials, or to carry molecular cargos, allowing their utilization as imaging reagents, immunomodulators, therapeutics, nanoreactors, and biosensors. The medical applications of plant viruses benefit from their inability to infect and replicate in human cells. The structural properties of plant viruses also make them useful as components of hydrogels for tissue engineering. Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks composed of hydrophilic polymers that can absorb large amounts of water. They are used as supports for tissue regeneration, as reservoirs for controlled drug release, and are found in contact lenses, many wound healing materials, and hygiene products. They are also useful in ecological applications such as wastewater treatment. Hydrogel-based matrices are structurally similar to the native extracellular matrix (ECM) and provide a scaffold for the attachment of cells. To fully replicate the functions of the ECM it is necessary to augment hydrogels with biological cues that regulate cellular interactions. This can be achieved by incorporating functionalized VNPs displaying ligands that influence the mechanical characteristics of hydrogels and their biological properties, promoting the survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of embedded cells.

With the anti-cancer prodrug CB1954, both enzymes were more effective than the canonical O2-insensitive nitroreductase E.coli NfsB (NfsB_Ec),NfsA_Nm exhibiting comparable levels of activity to the leading nitroreductase candidate E. coli NfsA (NfsA_Ec). NfsA_Nm is also the first NfsA-family nitroreductase shown to produce a substantial proportion of 4-hydroxylamine end-product. NfsA_Nm and PnbA_Bh were again more efficient than NfsB_Ec at aerobic activation of metronidazole to a cytotoxic form, with NfsA_Nm appearing a promising candidate for improving zebrafish-targeted cell ablation models. NfsA_Nm was also more active than either NfsA_Ec or NfsB_Ec with 2,4- or 2,6-dinitrotoluene substrates, whereas PnbA_Bh was relatively inefficient with either substrate.CONCLUSIONS: NfsA_Nm is a promising new nitroreductase candidate for several diverse biotechnological applications.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"8","0","0","0","6","0","8",NA,NA,"","1573-6776",NA,"MEDLINE:29147875","29147875",NA

Community fingerprinting comparisons and 16S rDNA sequence identifications were used for characterization of the bacterial population using specific primers. The bacterial characterization of soil samples revealed four major phyla: Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In situ (desert) samples of both rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric bulk soil were dominated by the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, whereas the phylum Betaproteobacteria was present only in non-rhizospheric bulk soil. Ex situ (nursery growing condition) V. pachyceras resulted in restricted bacterial communities dominated by members of a single phylum, Bacteroidetes. Results indicated that the soil organic matter and rhizospheric environments might drive the bacterial community. Despite harsh climatic conditions, data demonstrated that V. pachyceras roots harbor endophytic bacterial populations. Our findings on bacterial community composition and structure have major significance for evaluating how Kuwait's extreme climatic conditions affect bacterial communities. The baseline data obtained in this study will be useful and assist in formulating strategies in ecological restoration programs, including the application of inoculation technologies.","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","0","0","0","1","0","1",NA,NA,"","1480-3275",NA,"MEDLINE:30495976","30495976",NA
