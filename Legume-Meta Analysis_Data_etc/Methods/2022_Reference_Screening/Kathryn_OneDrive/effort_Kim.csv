Ten bacterial isolates produced functional nodules on D. lignosus. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences identified one isolate as Bradyrhizobium sp., one isolate as Rhizobium sp. and eight isolates as Burkholderia sp. The Bradyrhizobium sp. and Rhizobium sp. 16S rRNA sequences were identical to those of strains previously isolated from crop plants and may have originated from inocula used on crops. Both 16S rRNA and DNA recombinase A (recA) gene sequences placed the eight Burkholderia isolates separate from previously described Burkholderia rhizobial species. However, the isolates showed a very close relationship to Burkholderia rhizobial strains isolated from South African plants with respect to their nitrogenase iron protein (nifH), N-acyltransferase nodulation protein A (nodA) and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase nodulation protein C (nodC) gene sequences. Gene sequences and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR and repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) banding patterns indicated that the eight Burkholderia isolates separated into five clones of one strain and three of another. One strain was tested and shown to produce functional nodules on a range of South African plants previously reported to be nodulated by Burkholderia tuberum STM678(T) which was isolated from the Cape Region. Thus, evidence is strong that the Burkholderia strains isolated here originated in South Africa and were somehow transported with the plants from their native habitat to NZ.

Studies on transcontinental invasions have revealed that invasive species perform better in the invasive range than in their native ranges. We assumed that the same regularity exists in intracontinental invasions and thus investigated whether the reproductive traits of Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius, perform better in the alien invasive range in Europe compared to its native range in the same continent. The aim of this research was to reveal the potential and realised fecundity of C. scoparius in its native and invasive ranges, as well as relationships with the size of pods, habitat type, and how these traits vary at the same site in different years. The results of this study were not able to unambiguously confirm our hypothesis that C. scoparius in the invasive range in Lithuania, specifically in the southern part of the Boreal biogeographical region, outperform plants in the native range with regard to the analysed reproductive traits. Potential fecundity of C. scoparius in the native range was significantly higher than in the invaded range; however, realised fecundity was not significantly different between the native and invasive ranges. The pod length was similar in both ranges, whereas the pod width was significantly greater in the invasive range than in the native range. The results suggest that the number of ovules per pod, number of matured seeds, and the size of pods are related with the type of habitat and local environmental conditions in the habitat. Although many studies on other species have confirmed higher fecundity and overall better performance of plants in the invasive range than in the native range on other continents, this rule probably cannot be applied for intracontinental invasive species occurring in relatively close geographical regions to their native ranges.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,2223-7747,,NA,MEDLINE:36015460,36015460,NA

Using legume-rhizobium mutualistic interactions as an example, we discuss two pathways that can influence symbiotic associations in such situations: co-introduction of coevolved rhizobia; and utilization of, and adaptation to, resident rhizobia, hereafter referred to as 'ecological fitting'. Co-introduction and ecological fitting have distinct implications for successful legume invasions and their impacts. Under ecological fitting, initial impacts may be less severe and will accrue over longer periods as novel symbiotic associations and/or adaptations may require fine-tuning over time. Co-introduction will have more profound impacts that will accrue more rapidly as a result of positive feedbacks between densities of non-native rhizobia and their coevolved host plants, in turn enhancing competition between native and non-native rhizobia. Co-introduction can further impact invasion outcomes by the exchange of genetic material between native and non-native rhizobia, potentially resulting in decreased fitness of native legumes. A better understanding of the roles of these two pathways in the invasion dynamics of non-native legumes is much needed, and we highlight some of the exciting research avenues it presents.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30,0,1,0,31,0,32,NA,NA,,1469-8137,NA,MEDLINE:28771816,28771816,NA

It has not been until recently that these mutualisms-mycorrhizas and legume-rhizobia on one hand, and pollinators and seed dispersers on the other hand-have been found to influence each other, with potential ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here we review the mechanisms that may link these two-level mutualisms, mostly reported for native plant species, and make predictions about their relevance during alien plant invasions. We propose that alien plants establishing effective mutualisms with belowground microbes might improve their reproductive success through positive interactions between those mutualists and pollinators and seed dispersers. On the other hand, changes in the abundance and diversity of soil mutualists induced by invasion can also interfere with below-aboveground links for native plant species.

The hallmark of an efficient quorum sensing system relies on the tight specificity in the signal generated by each bacterium. Since AHL signal specificity is derived from the acyl-chain of the acyl-ACP (ACP = acyl carrier protein) substrate, AHL synthase enzymes must recognize and react with the native acyl-ACP with high catalytic efficiency while keeping reaction rates with non-native acyl-ACPs low. The mechanism of acyl-ACP substrate recognition in these enzymes, however, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated differences in catalytic efficiencies for shorter and longer chain acyl-ACP substrates reacting with an octanoyl-homoserine lactone synthase Burkholderia mallei BmaI1. With the exception of two-carbon shorter hexanoyl-ACP, the catalytic efficiencies of butyryl-ACP, decanoyl-ACP, and octanoyl-CoA reacting with BmaI1 decreased by greater than 20-fold compared to the native octanoyl-ACP substrate. Furthermore, we also noticed kinetic cooperativity when BmaI1 reacted with non-native acyl-donor substrates.

Choosing particular plant genotypes for domestication and subsequent cultivar selection can narrow the gene pools of crop plants to a degree that they are no longer able to benefit from microbial mutualists. Elevated mineral nutrient levels in cultivated soils also reduce the dependence of crops on nutritional support by mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia. Thus, current ways of crop production are predestined to compromise the propagation and function of microbial symbionts, limiting their long-term benefits for plant yield stability. The influence of mutualists on non-native plant establishment and spread, i.e. biological invasions, provides an unexplored analogue to contemporary crop production that accounts for mutualistic services from symbionts like rhizobia and mycorrhizae. The historical exposure of organisms to biotic interactions over evolutionary timescales, or so-called eco-evolutionary experience (EEE), has been used to explain the success of such invasions. In this paper, we stress that consideration of the EEE concept can shed light on how to overcome the loss of microbial mutualist functions following crop domestication and breeding.

STM 6070 is a heavy metal-tolerant strain that is highly effective at fixing nitrogen with M. pudica. Here we have provided an updated taxonomy for STM 6070 and described salient features of the annotated genome, focusing on heavy metal resistance (HMR) loci and heavy metal efflux (HME) systems.RESULTS: The 6,771,773bp high-quality-draft genome consists of 107 scaffolds containing 6118 protein-coding genes. ANI values show that STM 6070 is a new species of Cupriavidus. The STM 6070 symbiotic region was syntenic with that of the M. pudica-nodulating Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG 19424T. In contrast to the nickel and zinc sensitivity of C. taiwanensis strains, STM 6070 grew at high Ni2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. The STM 6070 genome contains 55 genes, located in 12 clusters, that encode HMR structural proteins belonging to the RND, MFS, CHR, ARC3, CDF and P-ATPase protein superfamilies. These HMR molecular determinants are putatively involved in arsenic (ars), chromium (chr), cobalt-zinc-cadmium (czc), copper (cop, cup), nickel (nie and nre), and silver and/or copper (sil) resistance. Seven of these HMR clusters were common to symbiotic and non-symbiotic Cupriavidus species, while four clusters were specific to STM 6070, with three of these being associated with insertion sequences. Within the specific STM 6070 HMR clusters, three novel HME-RND systems (nieIC cep nieBA, czcC2B2A2, and hmxB zneAC zneR hmxS) were identified, which constitute new candidate genes for nickel and zinc resistance.CONCLUSIONS: STM 6070 belongs to a new Cupriavidus species, for which we have proposed the name Cupriavidus neocaledonicus sp. nov.. STM6070 harbours a pSym with a high degree of gene conservation to the pSyms of M. pudica-nodulating C. taiwanensis strains, probably as a result of recent horizontal transfer.

In domestic swine, brucellosis results in reproductive failure due to abortions and infertility. Contact with infected feral swine poses spillover risks to domestic pigs as well as humans, companion animals, wildlife, and other livestock. Genetic factors influence the outcome of infectious diseases; therefore, genome wide association studies (GWAS) of differential immune responses among feral swine can provide an understanding of disease dynamics and inform management to prevent the spillover of brucellosis from feral swine to domestic pigs. We sought to identify loci associated with differential antibody responses among feral swine naturally infected with B. suis using a case-control GWAS. Tissue, serum, and genotype data (68,516 bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms) collected from 47 feral swine were analyzed in this study. The 47 feral swine were culture positive for Brucella spp. Of these 47, 16 were antibody positive (cases) whereas 31 were antibody negative (controls). Single-locus GWAS were performed using efficient mixed-model association eXpedited (EMMAX) methodology with three genetic models: additive, dominant, and recessive. Eight loci associated with seroconversion were identified on chromosome 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 18. Subsequent bioinformatic analyses revealed nine putative candidate genes related to immune function, most notably phagocytosis and induction of an inflammatory response. Identified loci and putative candidate genes may play an important role in host immune responses to B. suis infection, characterized by a detectable bacterial presence yet a differential antibody response.

The patient was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, pulmonary sepsis and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Examination revealed diminished bilateral vesicular breath sounds, fever, intense yellow tracheal secretions, a respiratory rate of 24/minute, a heart rate of 123/minute, and blood pressure of 75/55 mmHg. Vasoactive treatment was initiated. Investigations revealed elevated lactate and C-reactive protein levels. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration. Parenteral ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were administered. Tracheal aspirate culture and blood culture showed bacterial growth of Cupriavidus pauculus. Colistin was added to the treatment. There was a poor clinical response despite repeated blood culture showing negative results. The diagnosis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) caused by C. pauculus was made.

Members of the genus Ensifer are best known for their ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with forage legumes of three related genera, Medicago L., Melilotus Mill., and Trigonella L., which are members of the tribe Trifolieae. These legumes have a natural distribution extending from the Mediterranean Basin through western Asia, where there is an unsurpassed number of species belonging to these genera. Trigonella suavissima L. is unusual in that it is the only species in the tribe Trifolieae that is native to Australia. We compared the genetic diversity and taxonomic placement of rhizobia nodulating T. suavissima with those of members of an Ensifer reference collection. Our goal was to determine if the T. suavissima rhizobial strains, like their plant host, are naturally limited to the Australian continent. We used multilocus sequence analysis to estimate the genetic relatedness of 56 T. suavissima symbionts to 28 Ensifer reference strains. Sequence data were partitioned according to the replicons in which the loci are located. The results were used to construct replicon-specific phylogenetic trees. In both the chromosomal and chromid trees, the Australian strains formed a distinct clade within E. meliloti The strains also shared few alleles with Ensifer reference strains from other continents. Carbon source utilization assays revealed that the strains are also unusual in their ability to utilize 2-oxoglutarate as a sole carbon source. A strategy was outlined for locating similar strains elsewhere.IMPORTANCE In this study, we employed a biogeographical approach to investigate the origins of a symbiotic relationship between an Australian legume and its nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The question of the ancestral origins of these symbionts is based on the observation that the legume host is not closely related to other native Australian legumes. Previous research has shown that the legume host Trigonella suavissima is instead closely related to legumes native to the Mediterranean Basin and western Asia, suggesting that it may have been introduced in Australia from those regions. This led to the question of whether its rhizobia may have been introduced as well. In this study, we were unable to find persuasive evidence supporting this hypothesis. Instead, our results suggest either that the T. suavissima rhizobia are native to Australia or that our methods for locating their close relatives elsewhere are inadequate. A strategy to investigate the latter alternative is proposed.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,NA,NA,,1098-5336,NA,MEDLINE:28283520,28283520,NA

The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific surface characteristics of MCPA-degrading bacteria could be linked to their degrading capabilities in sand filters. Four MCPA degraders with different taxonomic affiliations and original habitats (Sphingomonas sp. PM2, Sphingomonas sp. ERG5, Burkholderia sp. TFD34, Cupriavidus sp. TFD38) were characterised with regard to their motility, cell surface hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, adhesion behaviour and ability to mineralise MCPA. Strains PM2 and ERG5 were non-motile and hydrophobic, whilst strains TFD34 and TFD38 were motile and less hydrophobic. All the strains except ERG5 showed low biofilm formation on polystyrene, although it was significantly higher on glass. PM2 was the most efficient MCPA degrader as it displayed no lag phase and reached >50% mineralisation at all concentrations (0.0016-25mgL-1). PM2 adhered significantly better to sand than the other strains. No link was found between motility, biofilm formation and the ability to adhere to sand. PM2 completely removed MCPA for 14days when inoculated in sand columns with a constant inlet of 1mgL-1 MCPA. These results demonstrate that besides the ability to degrade the contaminant, surface hydrophobicity and adherence abilities are significant parameters controlling sustained degradation in flow-through sand columns and must be considered when selecting bacteria for bioaugmentation.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,0,0,0,9,0,10,NA,NA,,1432-0614,NA,MEDLINE:27734123,27734123,NA

Selection on cooperation and standing genetic variation for mutualism traits may differ between a mutualism's invaded and native ranges, which could alter cooperation and coevolutionary dynamics. To test for such differences, we compare mutualism traits between invaded- and native-range host-symbiont genotype combinations of the weedy legume, Medicago polymorpha, and its nitrogen-fixing rhizobium symbiont, Ensifer medicae, which have coinvaded North America. We find that mutualism benefits for plants are indistinguishable between invaded- and native-range symbioses. However, rhizobia gain greater fitness from invaded-range mutualisms than from native-range mutualisms, and this enhancement of symbiont fecundity could increase the mutualism's spread by increasing symbiont availability during plant colonization. Furthermore, mutualism traits in invaded-range symbioses show lower genetic variance and a simpler partitioning of genetic variance between host and symbiont sources, compared to native-range symbioses. This suggests that biological invasion has reduced mutualists' potential to respond to coevolutionary selection.

One site was invaded by a grass (Microstegium vimineum), another by a shrub (Rhamnus davurica), and the third by a tree (Ailanthus altissima). The native vegetation from these sites was used as reference. 16S rRNA and ITS regions were sequenced to study root-zone bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, in invaded and non-invaded samples and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). Though root-zone microbial community structure initially differed across locations, plant invasion shifted communities in similar ways. Indicator species analysis revealed that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) closely related to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota increased in abundance due to plant invasions. The Hyphomonadaceae family in the Rhodobacterales order and ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospirae phylum showed greater relative abundance in the invaded root-zone soils.

In agreement with phylogenetic and functional analyses, greater turnover of ammonium and nitrate was associated with plant invasion.

Here, we ask (1) does the community of rhizobial mutualists associated with invasive legumes in their exotic range overlap with that of local native legumes and (2) can any differences be explained by fundamental incompatibilities with particular rhizobial genotypes? To address these questions, we first characterized the rhizobial communities naturally associating with three invasive and six native legumes growing in the San Francisco Bay Area. We then conducted a greenhouse experiment to test whether the invasive legume could nodulate with any of a broad array of rhizobia found in their exotic range. There was little overlap between the Bradyrhizobium communities associated with wild-grown invasive and native legumes, yet the invasive legumes could nodulate with a broad range of rhizobial strains under greenhouse conditions. These observations suggest that under field conditions in their exotic range, these invasive legumes are not currently associating with the mutualists of local native legumes, despite their potential to form such associations. However, the promiscuity with which these invading legumes can form mutualistic associations could be an important factor early in the invasion process if mutualist scarcity limits range expansion. Overall, the observation that invasive legumes have a community of rhizobia distinct from that of native legumes, despite their ability to associate with many rhizobial strains, challenges existing assumptions about how invading species obtain their mutualists.

We identified a novel nodulation gene located on the symbiotic plasmid pRalta, called noeM, which is involved in this atypical Nod factor structure. noeM encodes a transmembrane protein bearing a fatty acid hydroxylase domain. This gene is expressed during symbiosis with M. pudica and requires NodD and luteolin for optimal expression. The closest noeM homologs formed a separate phylogenetic clade containing rhizobial genes only, which are located on symbiosis plasmids downstream from a nod box. Corresponding proteins, referred to as NoeM, may have specialized in symbiosis via the connection to the nodulation pathway and the spread in rhizobia. noeM was mostly found in isolates of the Mimoseae tribe, and specifically detected in all tested strains able to nodulate M. pudica. A noeM deletion mutant of C. taiwanensis was affected for the nodulation of M. pudica, confirming the role of noeM in the symbiosis with this legume.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,NA,NA,0894-0282,,NA,MEDLINE:31617792,31617792,NA

Activation of cell-autonomous autophagy mechanism eliminate intracellular pathogens in which p62 a cytosolic cargo protein is selectively degraded, and an accumulation of this marker occurs if autophagy is deficient. Recurrent, relapsed and reinfection of B. pseudomallei in melioidosis patients in endemic area indicative of lack of complete of clearance and persistence of the pathogen. Reasoning that abundance in the levels of p62 may provide an indication of the intracellular infection, we sought to examine whether increase in intracellular p62 and bacterial burden with Burkholderia infection are linked to autophagy deficiency.METHODS: In this study, we investigated cell culture and mouse models of disease to identify an association between autophagy biomarkers (p62/NBR1) accumulation and intracellular persistence of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei.RESULTS: We demonstrate, that elevated levels of intracellular p62/NBR1 correlated with bacterial persistence, while pre-treatment with a pharmacological inducer of autophagy, rapamycin, reduced both intracellular p62, and bacterial survival. Our results showed an elevated p62 levels (2-5 fold) in spleen and liver cells of Burkholderia-infected BALB/c mice, as well as in spleen cells of Burkholderia-infected C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that an increase in p62/NBR1 was due to an autophagy deficiency. Similar to p62, cytosolic LC3-I levels were also elevated, while the characteristic conversion to the autophagosome-associated membrane bound form LC3-II was low in spleens of the infected mice further supporting the conclusion that autophagy was deficient.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that an increase in intracellular p62/NBR1 may be a potential host cell biomarker of B. mallei or B. pseudomallei infections, and identifying autophagy manipulation may potentially aid to therapeutic approach for complete clearance of the pathogen.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,2,0,0,7,0,9,NA,NA,,2050-4527,NA,MEDLINE:30569531,30569531,NA

To replay the evolution of a new rhizobium genus under laboratory conditions, the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis was introduced in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and the generated proto-rhizobium was submitted to repeated inoculations to the C. taiwanensis host, Mimosa pudica L.. This experiment validated a two-step evolutionary scenario of key symbiotic gene acquisition followed by genome remodeling under plant selection. Nodulation and nodule cell infection were obtained and optimized mainly via the rewiring of regulatory circuits of the recipient bacterium. Symbiotic adaptation was shown to be accelerated by the activity of a mutagenesis cassette conserved in most rhizobia.

This gene has homology to fixL of the rhizobial FixL/FixJ two-component system. The goals of this study were to determine the functions of FixLJ and their role in virulence in B. dolosa. We generated a fixLJ deletion mutant and complemented controls in B. dolosa strain AU0158. Using a fixK-lacZ reporter we found that FixLJ was activated in low oxygen in multiple BCC species. In a murine pneumonia model, the B. dolosa fixLJ deletion mutant was cleared faster from the lungs and spleen than wild-type B. dolosa strain AU0158 at 7 days post infection. Interestingly, the fixLJ deletion mutant made more biofilm, albeit with altered structure, but was less motile than strain AU0158. Using RNA-seq with in vitro grown bacteria, we found ~11% of the genome was differentially expressed in the fixLJ deletion mutant relative to strain AU0158. Multiple flagella-associated genes were down-regulated in the fixLJ deletion mutant, so we also evaluated virulence of a fliC deletion mutant, which lacks a flagellum.

Intensive training was started for all nursing staff involved in patient care. Cultures were sent from the environment (surfaces, water, air), intravenous fluids, disinfectants and antiseptics and opened/unopened medication.RESULTS: A total of 13 patients with cancer with tunneled catheters were affected with BCC BSI. The isolates were of similar antimicrobial sensitivity. No significant breach of infection control protocols could be identified. Cultures from the prepared intravenous medication bags grew BCC. Subsequently, culture from unused vials of the antiemetic granisetron grew BCC, whereas those from the unopened IV fluid bag and chemotherapy medication were negative. On review, it was discovered that the outbreak started when a new brand of granisetron was introduced. The result was communicated to the manufacturer and the brand was withdrawn. There were no further cases.CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was thus linked to intrinsic contamination of medication vials.

In previous work, we introduced the symbiotic plasmid of Cupriavidus taiwanensis, the rhizobial symbiont of Mimosa pudica, into the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and selected three variants able to form root nodules on M.pudica, two (CBM212 and CBM349) being able to rudimentarily infect nodule cells and the third one (CBM356) only capable of extracellular infection of nodules.

In this study, we compared the phenotype of the 18 final evolved clones. Evolution through short and long cycles resulted in similar adaptive paths on lineages deriving from the two intracellularly infectious ancestors, CBM212 and CBM349.

The global burden and distribution of melioidosis is poorly understood, including in the Caribbean. B. pseudomallei was previously isolated from humans and soil in eastern Puerto Rico but the abundance and distribution of B. pseudomallei in Puerto Rico as a whole has not been thoroughly investigated.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected 600 environmental samples (500 soil and 100 water) from 60 sites around Puerto Rico. We identified B. pseudomallei by isolating it via culturing and/or using PCR to detect its DNA within complex DNA extracts. Only three adjacent soil samples from one site were positive for B. pseudomallei with PCR; we obtained 55 isolates from two of these samples. The 55 B. pseudomallei isolates exhibited fine-scale variation in the core genome and contained four novel genomic islands. Phylogenetic analyses grouped Puerto Rico B. pseudomallei isolates into a monophyletic clade containing other Caribbean isolates, which was nested inside a larger clade containing all isolates from Central/South America. Other Burkholderia species were commonly observed in Puerto Rico; we cultured 129 isolates from multiple soil and water samples collected at numerous sites around Puerto Rico, including representatives of B. anthina, B. cenocepacia, B. cepacia, B. contaminans, B. glumae, B. seminalis, B. stagnalis, B. ubonensis, and several unidentified novel Burkholderia spp.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: B. pseudomallei was only detected in three soil samples collected at one site in north central Puerto Rico with only two of those samples yielding isolates. All previous human and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates were obtained from eastern Puerto Rico. These findings suggest B. pseudomallei is ecologically established and widely dispersed in the environment in Puerto Rico but rare. Phylogeographic patterns suggest the source of B. pseudomallei populations in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the Caribbean may have been Central or South America.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,0,0,0,15,0,16,NA,NA,,1935-2735,NA,MEDLINE:31487287,31487287,NA

However, the mechanisms for nitrate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) and As(III) remain unclear. In this study, we isolated two bacterial strains from arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, Ensifer sp. ST2 and Paracoccus sp. QY30. Both strains were capable of anaerobic As(III) oxidation, but only QY30 could oxidize Fe(II) under nitrate-reducing conditions. Both strains contain the As(III) oxidase gene aioA, whose expression was induced greatly by As(III) exposure. Both strains contain the whole suite of genes for complete denitrification, but the nitrite reductase gene nirK was not expressed in QY30 and nitrite accumulated under nitrate-reducing conditions. When the functional nirK gene was knocked out in strain ST2, its nitrite reduction ability was completely abolished and nitrite accumulated in the medium. Moreover, the ST2DeltanirK mutant gained the ability to oxidize Fe(II). When nirK gene from ST2 was introduced to QY30, the recombinant strain QY30::nirK gained the ability to reduce nitrite but lost the ability to oxidize Fe(II). These genetic manipulations did not affect the ability of both strains to oxidize As(III). Our results indicate that nitrite accumulation is required for anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) but not for As(III) oxidation in these strains. The results suggest that anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation in the two bacterial strains is primarily driven by abiotic reaction of Fe(II) with nitrite, while reduction of nitrate to nitrite is sufficient for redox coupling with anaerobic As(III) oxidation catalyzed by Aio.

The present study introduces improved application of a polymerase chain reaction assay with relatively high sensitivity and specificity for the direct detection ofB. cepaciafrom the aqueous pharmaceutical products. A semi-nested polymerase chain reaction approach using the primer set BCR1/BCR2 followed by BCR1/Mr yielding a 465 bp fragment of the recA gene was applied and tested using both crude lysate from isolated colonies and DNA directly extracted from artificially prepared and spiked reference syrup.

However, recombination rates in other portions of the genome are also high, a feature we expected to disrupt gene order. We analyzed the pangenome of 37 isolates of B. pseudomallei and demonstrate that the pangenome is 'open', with approximately 136 new genes identified with each new genome sequenced, and that the global core genome consists of 4568±16 homologs. Genes associated with metabolism were statistically overrepresented in the core genome, and genes associated with mobile elements, disease, and motility were primarily associated with accessory portions of the pangenome. The frequency distribution of genes present in between 1 and 37 of the genomes analyzed matches well with a model of genome evolution in which 96% of the genome has very low recombination rates but 4% of the genome recombines readily. Using homologous genes among pairs of genomes, we found that gene order was highly conserved among strains, despite the high recombination rates previously observed. High rates of gene transfer and recombination are incompatible with retaining gene order unless these processes are either highly localized to specific sites within the genome, or are characterized by symmetrical gene gain and loss.

The engineering of bioluminescent bacteria required for photonic bioimaging is frequently hampered by lack of promoters suitable for strong, yet stable luciferase gene expression.RESULTS: We devised a novel method for identification of constitutive native promoters in Gram-negative bacteria. The method is based on a Tn5/7 transposon that exploits the unique features of Tn5 (random transposition) and Tn7 (site-specific transposition). The transposons are designed such that Tn5 transposition will allow insertion of a promoter-less bacterial luxCDABE operon downstream of a bacterial gene promoter. Cloning of DNA fragments from luminescent isolates results in a plasmid that replicates in pir (+) hosts. Sequencing of the lux-chromosomal DNA junctions on the plasmid reveals transposon insertion sites within genes or operons. The plasmid is also a mini-Tn7-lux delivery vector that can be used to introduce the promoter-lux operon fusion into other derivatives of the bacterium of interest in an isogenic fashion. Alternatively, promoter-containing sequences can be PCR-amplified from plasmid or chromosomal DNA and cloned into a series of accompanying mini-Tn7-lux vectors. The mini-Tn5/7-lux and mini-Tn7-lux vectors are equipped with diverse selection markers and thus applicable in numerous Gram-negative bacteria. Various mini-Tn5/7-lux vectors were successfully tested for transposition and promoter identification by imaging in Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Strong promoters were captured for lux expression in E. coli and A. baumannii. Some mini-Tn7-lux vectors are also equipped with attB sites for swapping of the lux operon with other reporter genes using Gateway technology.CONCLUSIONS: Although mini-Tn5-lux and mini-Tn7-lux elements have previously been developed and used for bacterial promoter identification and chromosomal insertion of promoter-lux gene fusions, respectively, the newly developed mini-Tn5/7-lux and accompanying accessory plasmids streamline and accelerate the promoter discovery and bioluminescent strain engineering processes.

Purpose: To determine the microbiology and outcomes of SAP in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) for patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: In this observational study, included patients were divided into SAP and non-SAP based on a comprehensive analysis of symptom, imaging, and laboratory results. Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (78.8%), followed by Gram-positive aerobic cocci (29.4%). The main pathogens included K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Burkholderia cepacia. SAP prolonged length of MV (p < 0.001), duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.027), shortened MV-free days by 28 (p < 0.001), and caused elevated vasopressor application (p = 0.001) and 60-day mortality (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with coma (p < 0.001) have a higher risk of developing SAP. Conclusion: The microbiology of SAP is similar to early phase of HAP and VAP. SAP prolongs the duration of MV and length of ICU and hospital stays, but also markedly increases 60-day mortality.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:34925251,34925251,NA

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in arid and semi-arid environments is frequently affected by harsh environmental stresses such as heat, drought and salinity, which limit its growth and productivity and affect biological nitrogen fixation ability of rhizobia. Climate change had further aggravated these stresses. Inoculation with appropriate stress tolerant rhizobia is necessary for an environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural production. In this study, endophytic bacteria isolated from chickpea nodules from different soil types and regions in Morocco, were evaluated for their phenotypic and genotypic diversity in order to select the most tolerant ones for further inoculation of this crop. Phenotypic characterization of 135 endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules showed a wide variability for tolerance to heavy metals and antibiotics, variable response to extreme temperatures, salinity, pH and water stress. 56% of isolates were able to nodulate chickpea. Numerical analysis of rep-PCR results showed that nodulating strains fell into 22 genotypes. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene of endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules revealed that 55% of isolated bacteria belong to Mesorhizobium genus. Based on MLSA of core genes (recA, atpD, glnII and dnaK), tasted strains were distributed into six clades and were closely related to Mesorhizobium ciceri, Mesorhizobium opportunistum, Mesorhizobium qingshengii, and Mesorhizobium plurifarium. Most of nodulating strains were belonging to a group genetically distinct from reference Mesorhizobium species. Three isolates belong to genus Burkholderia of the class beta- proteobacteria, and 55 other strains belong to the class gamma- proteobacteria.

An aldehyde reductase gene (alrd) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH) from Ralstonia eutropha H16 were integrated into the E. coli chromosome to form a novel glycerol-utilization pathway. The beta-carotene specific production value was increased by 50% after the introduction of alrd and aldH.

Next, the effectiveness of PSB on increasing plant biomass and P-uptake is assessed using a meta-analysis approach. Our review demonstrates that improved P-uptake does not always translate in improved plant height and biomass. We show that the effect of PSB on plants does not provide an added benefit when using bacterial consortia compared to single strains. Moreover, the commonly reported species for P-solubilization, Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., are outperformed by the scarcely implemented Burkholderia spp. Despite the similar responses to PSB in monocots and eudicots, species responsiveness to PSB varies within both clades.

Their ecological success is partly due to the selective advantage provided by their symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia, which allow legumes to thrive on marginal lands and nitrogen depleted soils where non-symbiotic plants cannot grow. Additionally, their symbiotic capacities result in a high protein content in their aerial parts and seeds. This interesting nutritional value has led to the domestication and agricultural exploitation of several legumes grown for seeds and/or fodder for human and domestic animal consumption. Several cultivated legume species are thus grown far beyond their natural geographic range. Other legume species have become invasives, spreading into new habitats. The cultivation and establishment of legume species outside of their original range requires either that they are introduced or cultivated along with their original symbiotic partner or that they find an efficient symbiotic partner in their introduced habitat. The peanut, Arachis hypogaea, a native of South America, is now cultivated throughout the world. This species forms root nodules with Bradyrhizobium, but it is unclear whether these came with the seeds from their native range or were acquired locally. Here we propose to investigate the phylogeography of Bradyrhizobium spp. associated with a number of different wild and cultivated legume species from a range of geographical areas, including numerous strains isolated from peanut roots across the areas of peanut cultivation. This will allow us to address the question of whether introduced/cultivated peanuts associate with bacteria from their original geographic range, i.e., were introduced together with their original bacterial symbionts, or whether they acquired their current associations de novo from the bacterial community within the area of introduction. We will base the phylogenetic analysis on sequence data from both housekeeping and core genes and a symbiotic gene (nif).

These black rats can transmit a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria of the genus Bartonella, which can cause diseases in humans and animals. In Chile, no data are available identifying fleas from synanthropic rodents as Bartonella vectors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in the fleas of R. rattus in areas with different climate conditions and featuring different human population densities.METHODS: In all, 174 fleas collected from 261 R. rattus captured from 30 localities with different human densities (cities, villages, and wild areas) across five hydrographic zones of Chile (hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and hyper-humid) were examined. Bartonella spp. presence was determined through polymerase chain reaction, using gltA and rpoB genes, which were concatenated to perform a similarity analysis with BLAST and phylogenetic analysis.RESULTS: Overall, 15 fleas species were identified; Bartonella gltA and rpoB fragments were detected in 21.2% (37/174) and 19.5% (34/174) of fleas, respectively. A total of 10 of the 15 fleas species found were positive for Bartonella DNA. Leptopsylla segnis was the most commonly collected flea species (n = 55), and it also presented a high prevalence of Bartonella DNA (P% = 34.5%). The highest numbers of fleas of this species were collected in villages of the arid zone. There were no seasonal differences in the prevalence of Bartonella DNA. The presence of Bartonella DNA in fleas was recorded in all hydrographic areas, and the arid zone presented the highest prevalence of this species. Regarding areas with different human densities, the highest prevalence was noted in the villages (34.8% gltA and 31.8% rpoB), followed by cities (14.8% gltA and 11.1% rpoB) and wild areas (7.4% gltA and 14.8% rpoB). The BLAST analysis showed a high similitude (>96%) with four uncharacterized Bartonella genotypes and with two species with zoonotic potential: B. mastomydis and B. tribocorum. The phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with B. elizabethae and B. tribocorum. This is the first study to provide evidence of the presence of Bartonella in fleas of R. rattus in Chile, indicating that the villages and arid zone correspond to areas with higher infection risk.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11,0,0,0,9,1,11,NA,NA,2167-8359,,NA,MEDLINE:31396444,31396444,NA

When rhizobia in the genus Mesorhizobium have been introduced with exotic legumes into farming systems, horizontal transfer of symbiosis Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) from the inoculant strain to soil bacteria has resulted in the evolution of ineffective N2-fixing rhizobia that are competitive for nodulation with the target legume. In Australia, Cicer arietinum (chickpea) has been inoculated since the 1970's with Mesorhizobium ciceri sv. ciceri CC1192, a highly effective strain from Israel. Although the full genome sequence of this organism is available, little is known about the mobility of its symbiosis genes and the diversity of cultivated C. arietinum-nodulating organisms. Here, we show the CC1192 genome harbors a 419-kb symbiosis ICE (ICEMcSym1192) and a 648-kb repABC-type plasmid pMC1192 carrying putative fix genes. We sequenced the genomes of 11 C. arietinum nodule isolates from a field site exclusively inoculated with CC1192 and showed they were diverse unrelated Mesorhizobium carrying ICEMcSym1192, indicating they had acquired the ICE by environmental transfer. No exconjugants harboured pMc1192 and the plasmid was not essential for N2 fixation in CC1192. Laboratory conjugation experiments confirmed ICEMcSym1192 is mobile, integrating site-specifically within the 3' end of one of the four ser-tRNA genes in the R7ANS recipient genome. Strikingly, all ICEMcSym1192 exconjugants were as efficient at fixing N2 with C. arietinum as CC1192, demonstrating ICE transfer does not necessarily yield ineffective microsymbionts as previously observed.Importance Symbiotic N2 fixation is a key component of sustainable agriculture and in many parts of the world legumes are inoculated with highly efficient strains of rhizobia to maximise fixed N2 inputs into farming systems. Symbiosis genes for Mesorhizobium spp. are often encoded chromosomally within mobile gene clusters called Integrative and Conjugative Elements or ICEs. In Australia, where all agricultural legumes and their rhizobia are exotic, horizontal transfer of ICEs from inoculant Mesorhizobium strains to native rhizobia has led to the evolution of inefficient strains that outcompete the original inoculant, with the potential to render it ineffective. However, the commercial inoculant strain for Cicer arietinum (chickpea), M. ciceri CC1192, has a mobile symbiosis ICE (ICEMcSym1192) which can support high rates of N2 fixation following either environmental or laboratory transfer into diverse Mesorhizobium backgrounds, demonstrating ICE transfer does not necessarily yield ineffective microsymbionts as previously observed.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,0,0,0,6,0,6,NA,NA,,1098-5336,NA,MEDLINE:33355157,33355157,NA

A colony of social ants consists of various castes that exhibit distinct lifestyles and is, thus, a unique model for investigating how symbionts may be involved in host eusociality. Yet our knowledge of social ant-symbiont dynamics has remained rudimentary. Through 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing of the carpenter ant Camponotus japonicus symbiont community across various castes, we here report caste-dependent diversity of commensal gut microbiota and lineage divergence of Candidatus Blochmannia, an obligate endosymbiont. While most prevalent gut-associated bacterial populations are found across all castes (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria), we also discovered uncultured populations that are found only in males (belonging to Corynebacteriales, Alkanindiges, and Burkholderia). Most of those populations are not detected in laboratory-maintained queens and workers, suggesting that they are facultative gut symbionts introduced via environmental acquisition. Further inspection of Ca. Blochmannia endosymbionts reveals that two populations are dominant in all individuals across all castes but that males preferentially contain two different sublineages that are diversified from others. Clearly, each caste has distinct symbiont communities, suggesting an overlooked biological aspect of host-symbiont interaction in social insects.IMPORTANCE Social animals, such as primates and some insects, have been shown to exchange symbiotic microbes among individuals through sharing diet or habitats, resulting in increased consistency of microbiota among social partners. The ant is a representative of social insects exhibiting various castes within a colony; queens, males, and nonreproductive females (so-called workers) show distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors but tightly interact with each other in the nest. However, how this social context affects their gut microbiota has remained unclear.

Here, we demonstrate that interdomain communication through small RNA-containing membrane vesicles is bidirectional and that microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by human AECs regulate protein expression, antibiotic sensitivity, and biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa Specifically, human EVs deliver miRNA let-7b-5p to P. aeruginosa, which systematically decreases the abundance of proteins essential for biofilm formation, including PpkA and ClpV1-3, and increases the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to reduce biofilm formation by targeting the beta-lactamase AmpC. Let-7b-5p is bioinformatically predicted to target not only PpkA, ClpV1, and AmpC in P. aeruginosa but also the corresponding orthologs in Burkholderia cenocepacia, another notorious opportunistic lung pathogen, suggesting that the ability of let-7b-5p to reduce biofilm formation and increase beta-lactam sensitivity is not limited to P. aeruginosa Here, we provide direct evidence for transfer of miRNAs in EVs secreted by eukaryotic cells to a prokaryote, resulting in subsequent phenotypic alterations in the prokaryote as a result of this interdomain communication.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of presence of microbiological pathogens in graft among lung recipients and frequency of BI, considered as the indicator of severe complications.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was single-center retrospective cohort research; cases of 116 patients with complete microbiological data who underwent LTx from April 2013 to June 2019 were reviewed (70.3% of transplanted patients). All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 25.0 and R 3.5.3. For analyses involving the number of bronchoscopy interventions, univariate and multivariate Poisson regression were used. Interaction effect of variables in multivariate Poisson regression was assessed with partial response plot.RESULTS: The mean number of pathogens colonizing each patient was approximately 4.66 (range, 0 to 19) with Candida albicans (n= 42, 36.2%), Aspergillus spp. (n= 33, 28.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 32, 27.59%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n= 29, 25%) being the most prominent.

However, the repetitive structure of the TALE arrays composing the DBD impedes their generation as gene synthesis product and prevents the delivery of TALE-based genes using lentiviral vectors (LVs), a widely used system for human gene therapy. To overcome these limitations, we aimed at chimerizing the DNA sequence encoding for the TALE-DBDs by introducing sufficient diversity to facilitate both their gene synthesis and enable their lentiviral delivery. To this end, we replaced three out of 17 Xanthomonas TALE repeats with TALE-like units from the bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica. This was combined with extensive codon variation and specific amino acid substitutions throughout the DBD in order to maximize intra- and inter-repeat sequence variability. We demonstrate that chimerized TALEs can be easily generated using conventional Golden Gate cloning strategy or gene synthesis. Moreover, chimerization enabled the delivery of TALE-based designer nucleases, transcriptome and epigenome editors using lentiviral vectors. When delivered as plasmid DNA, chimerized TALEs targeting the CCR5 and CXCR4 loci showed comparable activities in human cells. However, lentiviral delivery of TALE-based transcriptional activators was only successful in the chimerized form. Similarly, delivery of a chimerized CXCR4-specific epigenome editor resulted in rapid silencing of endogenous CXCR4 expression. In conclusion, extensive codon variation and chimerization of TALE-based DBDs enables both the simplified generation and the lentiviral delivery of designer TALEs, and therefore facilitates the clinical application of these tools to precisely edit the genome, transcriptome and epigenome.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,NA,NA,,1422-0067,NA,MEDLINE:31991825,31991825,NA

Insight into the complex interaction between gut microbiota and the human adaptive immune system will help guide future immunotherapeutic cancer treatments to allow a more robust clinical response and fewer adverse effects in patients requiring these drugs. This review highlights these interactions as well as the potential for the creation of oncomicrobiotics that would selectively tailor one's GI bacteria to maximally respond to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatments will fewer adverse effects.MAIN BODY: CTLA-4 is an antigen on the surface of T cells which, upon stimulation, leads to inhibition of activated T cells to terminate the immune response. However, many types of tumor cells can upregulate CTLA-4 in the tumor microenvironment, allowing these cells to evade targeting and destruction by the body's immune system by prematurely inhibiting T cells. Increased representation of Bacteroides fragilis, Burkholderia cepacia and the Faecalibacterium genus in the GI tract of patients receiving CTLA-4-based immunotherapy led to a stronger therapeutic effect while minimizing adverse side effects such as colitis. In addition, by introducing bacteria involved in vitamin B and polyamine transport to the GI tracts of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 drugs led to increased resistance to colitis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.PD-1 is another molecule upregulated in many tumor microenvironments which acts in a similar manner to CTLA-4 to tone down the anti-neoplastic actions of T cells. Antibodies to PD-1 have shown promise to help allow the body's natural immune response to appropriately target and destroy tumor cells. The presence of Bifidobacterium breve and longum, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the GI tracts of cancer patients has the potential to create a more robust immune response to anti-PD-1 drugs and prolonged survival.The development of oncomicrobiotics has the potential to help tailor one's gut microbiota to allow patients to maximally respond to immunotherapy without sacrificing increases in toxicity. These oncomicrobiotics may possibly include antibiotics, probiotics, postbiotics and/or prebiotics.

In the alveolar space, chronic alcohol ingestion causes severe oxidative stress and depletes antioxidants which are critical for AM function. The mitochondrion is important in maintaining cellular redox balance and providing the ATP critical for phagocytosis. The focus of this study was to understand how alcohol triggers mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), stimulates cellular oxidative stress, and induces AM dysfunction. The current study also investigated the capacity of the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, mitoTEMPOL (mitoT), in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress, and AM dysfunction. Using in vitro ethanol exposure and AMs from ethanol-fed mice, ethanol promoted mitochondrial dysfunction including increased mitochondrial ROS, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP.

One bacterial strain, Ralstonia eutropha H16, which has the highest Ca2+ tolerance and is capable of performing both urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction in combined media was selected among three bacterial candidates based on the enzymatic examinations. Results showed that H16 does not need oxygen for urea hydrolysis and urease activity was determined primarily by cell concentration. However, the additional urea in the combined medium slowed down the nitrate reduction rate to 7days until full NO3- decomposition. Moreover, the nitrate reduction of H16 was significantly restricted by an increased Ca2+ ion concentration in the media. Nevertheless, the overall CaCO3 precipitation yield can be improved by 20 to 30% after optimization through the combination of two metabolic pathways. The highest total CaCO3 precipitation yield achieved in an orthogonal experiment was 14g/L.

Our previous research has challenged this view by showing that, in the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, deletion of the ribBA gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps on the RF biosynthesis pathway only causes a reduction in flavin secretion rather than RF auxotrophy. This finding led us to hypothesize that RibBA participates in the biosynthesis of flavins destined for secretion, whereas S.meliloti has another enzyme that performs this function for internal cellular metabolism. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize a novel formamidase (SMc02977) involved in the production of RF for intracellular functions in S.meliloti. This catalyst, which we named Sm-BrbF, releases formate fromthe early RF precursor 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate to yield 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate. We show that homologs of this enzyme are present in many bacteria, are highly abundant in the Rhizobiales order, and that sequence homologs from Brucella abortus and Liberobacter solanacearum complement the RF auxotrophy of the Sm1021DeltaSMc02977 mutant. Furthermore, we show that the B.abortus enzyme (Bab2_0247, Ba-BrbF) is also an 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate formamidase, and that the bab2_0247 mutant is a RF auxotroph exhibiting a lower level of intracellular infection than the wildtype strain.

We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid 'putting all your eggs in one basket'. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods.

Loss of enemies from the native habitat, such as parasites and pathogens, can allow for higher invader fitness in the invaded habitat. The presence of mutualists (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers, mycorrhizae, and rhizobial bacteria) in the invaded habitat can facilitate invasion success. Although there has been a great deal of research focusing on how invading hosts may benefit from enemy losses or mutualist gains, far less attention has focused on how native symbiont populations and communities respond to invasion by non-indigenous hosts and symbionts. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework examining how symbionts such as parasites, pathogens, commensals, and mutualists can influence invader success and whether these native symbionts will benefit or decline during invasion. The first major factor in this framework is the competence of the invading host relative to the native hosts. Low- or non-competent hosts that support few if any native symbionts could cause declines in native symbiont taxa. Competent invading hosts could potentially support native parasites, pathogens, commensals, and mutualists, especially if there is a closely related or similar host in the invaded range. These symbionts could inhibit or facilitate invasion or have no discernible effect on the invading host.

In Australia, the native-range lungworm Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala decreases its host's cardiac capacity, as well as growth and survival, but not rate of dispersal. The lungworm is most prevalent in long-colonised areas within the toads' Australian range, and absent from the invasion front. Several parasites and pathogens of Australian taxa have host-shifted to cane toads in Australia; for example, invasion-front toads are susceptible to spinal arthritis caused by the soil bacterium, Ochrobactrum anthropi. The pentastome Raillietiella frenata has host-shifted to toads and may thereby expand its Australian range due to the continued range expansion of the invasive toads. Spill-over and spill-back of parasites may be detrimental to other host species; however, toads may also reduce parasite loads in native taxa by acting as terminal hosts. We review the impact of the toad's parasites and pathogens on the invasive anuran's biology in Australia, as well as collateral effects of toad-borne parasites and pathogens on other host species in Australia.

In this study, the sequenced serotype M3 strain, MGAS315, and serotype M28 strain, MGAS6180, were characterized in parallel to determine whether contemporary M3 GAS has a higher capacity to invade soft tissues than M28 GAS. In subcutaneous infection, MGAS315 invaded almost the whole skin, inhibited neutrophil recruitment and TNF-alpha production, and was lethal in subcutaneous infection of mice, whereas MGAS6180 did not invade skin, induced robust neutrophil infiltration and TNF-alpha production, and failed to kill mice.

Either replacement of the covS1370T gene with wild-type covS in MGAS315 chromosome or in trans expression of wild-type covS in MGAS315 reduced expression of CovRS-controlled virulence genes hasA, spyCEP, and sse by >10 fold. MGAS315 covSwt lost the capacity to extensively invade skin and to inhibit neutrophil recruitment and had attenuated virulence, indicating that the covS G1370T mutation critically contribute to the hypervirulence of MGAS315. Under the background of functional CovRS, MGAS315 covSwt still caused greater lesions than MGAS6180, and, consistently under the background of covS deletion, MGAS6180 DeltacovS caused smaller lesions than MGAS315 DeltacovS. Thus, contemporary invasive M3 GAS has a higher capacity to evade neutrophil and TNF-alpha responses and to invade soft tissue than M28 GAS and that this skin-invading capacity of M3 GAS is maximized by natural CovRS mutations.

The resulting mutant strains and proteins were investigated with respect to their physiological, biochemical, and spectroscopic properties. Replacement of the four invariant conserved cysteine residues, Cys41, Cys44, Cys113, and Cys179, led to unstable protein, strongly supporting their involvement in the coordination of the iron-sulfur cluster proximal to the catalytic [NiFe] center. The Cys41Ser exchange, however, resulted in an SH variant that displayed up to 10% of wild-type activity, suggesting that the coordinating role of Cys41 might be partly substituted by the nearby Cys39 residue, which is present only in O2-tolerant pyridine nucleotide-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Indeed, SH variants carrying glycine, alanine, or serine in place of Cys39 showed increased O2 sensitivity compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of further amino acids typical for O2-tolerant SH representatives did not greatly affect the H2-oxidizing activity in the presence of O2. Remarkably, all mutant enzymes investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy did not reveal significant spectral changes in relation to wild-type SH, showing that the proximal iron-sulfur cluster does not contribute to the wild-type spectrum.

We established an experimental workflow for routinely using non-invasive Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to follow the allocation of leaf-supplied 11C tracer towards individual nodules in a three-dimensional (3D) root system of pea (Pisum sativum). Nitrate was used for triggering a reduction of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which was expected to rapidly affect carbon allocation dynamics in the root-nodule system.

The established experimental pipeline enabled for the first time that several plants could consistently be labelled and measured using 11C tracers in a PET approach to quantify C-allocation to individual nodules following a BNF reduction. Our study demonstrates the strength of using 11C tracers in a PET approach for non-invasive quantification of dynamic carbon allocation in several growing plants over several days.

Studies have highlighted the critical role of the soil aqueous phase in shaping interactions among soil bacterial communities. To quantify and improve the attributability of soil aqueous-phase effects, we introduced a synthetic and traceable bacterial community to simple porous microcosms and subjected the community to constant or dynamic hydration conditions. The results were expressed in terms of absolute abundance and show species-specific responses to hydration and nutrient conditions. Hydration dynamics exerted a significant influence on the fraction of less-abundant species, especially after extended incubation periods. Phylogenetic relationships did not explain the group of most abundant species. The ability to quantify species-level dynamics in a bacterial community offers an important step toward deciphering the links between community composition and functions in dynamic terrestrial environments.IMPORTANCE The composition and activity of soil bacteria are central to various ecosystem services and soil biogeochemical cycles. A key factor for soil bacterial activity is soil hydration, which is in a constant state of change due to rainfall, drainage, plant water uptake, and evaporation. These dynamic changes in soil hydration state affect the structure and function of soil bacterial communities in complex ways often unobservable in natural soil. We designed an experimental system that retains the salient features of hydrated soil yet enables systematic evaluation of changes in a representative bacterial community in response to cycles of wetting and drying. The study shows that hydration cycles affect community abundance, yet most changes in composition occur with the less-abundant species (while the successful ones remain dominant).

Evidence supports that the putative response regulator eepR was directly transcriptionally inhibited by cAMP-CRP. EepR and the putative sensor kinase EepS were necessary for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including prodigiosin- and serratamolide-dependent phenotypes, swarming motility, and hemolysis.

Together, these data introduce a novel regulator of secondary metabolites that directly connects the broadly conserved metabolism regulator CRP with biosynthetic genes that may contribute to competition with other microbes.IMPORTANCE: This study identifies a new transcription factor that is directly controlled by a broadly conserved transcription factor, CRP.

The stripping procedure was highly effective for ammonium removal, with an acceptable selectivity (91% of ammonium was removed; only 14% of total organic acids were lost). Both strains were able to produce hydrogen only in the nitrogen-stripped substrate. The natural strain R. palustris 42OL showed a higher Biochemical Hydrogen Potential (1224mll-1 vs 720mll-1 ; 50·0molm-3 vs 29·4molm-3 ), but at a lower rate (5·6mll-1 h-1 vs 7·3mll-1 h-1 ; 0·23molm-3 h-1 vs 0·29molm-3 h-1 ) than strain CGA676.CONCLUSIONS: Water lettuce waste biomass can be used for biofuel production, after hydrolization, fermentation and nitrogen stripping.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The investigation on novel, low cost and sustainable biomasses as feedstocks for biofuel production is a priority. Aquatic plants do not compete for arable land.

In this study, our goal was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the ability of A. philoxeroides to invade new habitats, to adapt to environmental stresses, and to cause damage. We developed a simple and highly effective potato virus X-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. The VIGS approach was first used to silence the phytoene desaturase gene, which resulted in the expected photo-bleaching phenotype. Next, the VIGS approach was used to silence two additional genes, drought-induced protein gene 15 (ApDRI15) and salinity-induced protein gene 1 (ApSI1). When ApDRI15 was knocked down, the plants were more sensitive to drought stress than the control plants, with smaller leaves, shorter internodes, and lower biomass. The ApDRI15-silenced plants had lower relative water content, lower free proline levels, and higher water loss rates than the control. Silencing of ApSI1 significantly decreased tolerance to salinity, and the ApSI1-silenced plants were withered and smaller. These results indicate that the pgR107 VIGS approach is a simple and highly effective tool for dissecting gene function in A. philoxeroides.

This phenomenon is regulated by small molecule or peptide signals, the best characterized of which are the N-acyl l-homoserine lactones (AHLs) utilized by Gram-negative bacteria. As many QS-controlled phenotypes, notably pathogenicity and symbiosis, can profoundly impact host eukaryotes, there is significant interest in developing methods for modulating QS signaling and either ameliorating or augmenting these phenotypes. One strategy has been the use of non-native AHL analogues to agonize or antagonize specific AHL receptors. This approach is complicated, however, by the potential for prospective hosts to respond to both native AHLs and synthetic analogues. Accordingly, identifying AHL analogues with little or no activity toward eukaryotes is important in developing QS modulation as a strategy for the regulation of prokaryotic behaviors. Herein, we utilize the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize eukaryotic responses to a variety of synthetic AHL analogues to identify structural elements of existing scaffolds that may elicit responses in prospective hosts. Our results indicate that, while many of these compounds have no discernible effect on A. thaliana, some elicit strong phenotypes similar to those produced by auxin, a hormone involved in almost all aspects of plant development. We outline concentrations and chemical scaffolds that are ideal for deployment on plant hosts for the regulation of QS.

Here, we introduced an actin-like mreB homolog from a pseudomonad into Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R (a microsymbiont of Astragalus sinicus L.) and examined the molecular, cellular, and symbiotic phenotypes of the resultant mutant. Exogenous mreB caused an enlarged cell size and slower growth in laboratory medium. However, the mutant formed small, ineffective nodules on A. sinicus (Nod+ Fix-), and rhizobial cells in the infection zone were unable to differentiate into bacteroids. RNA sequencing analysis also revealed minor effects of mreB on global gene expression in free-living cells but larger effects for cells grown in planta. Differentially expressed nodule-specific genes include cell cycle regulators such as the tubulin-like ftsZ1 and ftsZ2. Unlike the ubiquitous FtsZ1, an FtsZ2 homolog was commonly found in Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Mesorhizobium spp. but not in closely related nonsymbiotic species. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis revealed that MreB interacts with FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, which are targeted by the host-derived nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides. Significantly, MreB mutation D283A disrupted the protein-protein interactions and restored the aforementioned phenotypic defects caused by MreB in M. huakuii. Together, our data indicate that MreB is detrimental for modern rhizobia and its interaction with FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 causes the symbiotic process to cease at the late stage of bacteroid differentiation. These findings led to a hypothesis that loss of mreB in the common ancestor of members of Rhizobiales and subsequent acquisition of ftsZ2 are critical evolutionary steps leading to legume-rhizobial symbiosis.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

These processes depend on the activity of adenosine ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of GTP-binding proteins and their guanine exchange factors (GEFs). However, knowledge on the function and specificity of individual ARF-GEFs for individual steps of membrane trafficking pathways is still limited in plants.RESULTS: In this work, treatments with various trafficking inhibitors showed that the endocytosis of FM 4-64 is largely dynamin-dependent and relies on proteins containing endocytic tyrosine-based internalization motif and intact cytoskeleton. Interestingly, brefeldin A (BFA), reported previously as an inhibitor of anterograde membrane trafficking in plants, appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of endocytosis in tobacco. In concert with this finding, we demonstrate that the point mutation in the Sec7 domain of the GNOM-LIKE protein1a (NtGNL1a) confers intracellular trafficking pathway-specific BFA resistance. The internalization of FM 4-64 and trafficking of PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) auxin efflux carrier in BY-2 tobacco cells were studied to reveal the function of the ARF-GEF NtGNL1a in these.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our observations uncovered the role of NtGNL1a in endocytosis, including endocytosis of PM proteins (as PIN1 auxin efflux carrier). Moreover these data emphasize the need of careful evaluation of mode of action of non-native inhibitors in various species.

Mesorhizobium loti accumulates different di- and triglycosyl diacylglycerols, synthesized by the processive glycosyltransferase Pgt-Ml, and two so far unknown glycolipids, which were identified in this study by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as O-methyl-digalactosyl diacylglycerol (Me-DGD) and glucuronosyl diacylglycerol (GlcAD). Me-DGD is a novel glycolipid, whose synthesis depends on Pgt-Ml activity and the involvement of an unknown methyltransferase, while GlcAD is formed by a novel glycosyltransferase encoded by the open reading frame (ORF) mlr2668, using UDP-glucuronic acid as a sugar donor. Deletion mutants lacking GlcAD are not impaired in growth. Our data suggest that the different glycolipids in Mesorhizobium can mutually replace each other. This may be an adaptation mechanism to enhance the competitiveness in natural environments.

This has been shown to affect community assembly and physiological processes (e.g., stress tolerance, virulence, or cellular metabolic activity). Metabolic stress is typically quantified by measuring community phenotypic properties such as biomass growth, reactive oxygen species, or cell permeability. However, bulk community measurements do not take into account single-cell phenotypic diversity, which is important for a better understanding and the subsequent management of microbial populations. Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive alternative that provides detailed information on the biochemical makeup of each individual cell. Here, we introduce a method for describing single-cell phenotypic diversity using the Hill diversity framework of Raman spectra. Using the biomolecular profile of individual cells, we obtained a metric to compare cellular states and used it to study stress-induced changes. First, in two Escherichia coli populations either treated with ethanol or nontreated and then in two Saccharomyces cerevisiae subpopulations with either high or low expression of a stress reporter. In both cases, we were able to quantify single-cell phenotypic diversity and to discriminate metabolically stressed cells using a clustering algorithm. We also described how the lipid, protein, and nucleic acid compositions changed after the exposure to the stressor using information from the Raman spectra. Our results show that Raman spectroscopy delivers the necessary resolution to quantify phenotypic diversity within individual cells and that this information can be used to study stress-driven metabolic diversity in microbial populations.IMPORTANCE Microbial cells that live in the same community can exist in different physiological and morphological states that change as a function of spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions. This phenomenon is commonly known as phenotypic heterogeneity and/or diversity. Measuring this plethora of cellular expressions is needed to better understand and manage microbial processes. However, most tools to study phenotypic diversity only average the behavior of the sampled community. In this work, we present a way to quantify the phenotypic diversity of microbial samples by inferring the (bio)molecular profile of its constituent cells using Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate how this tool can be used to quantify the phenotypic diversity that arises after the exposure of microbes to stress. Raman spectroscopy holds potential for the detection of stressed cells in bioproduction.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,NA,NA,,2379-5042,NA,MEDLINE:33115836,33115836,NA

This work optimized the co-culture conditions of C.vulgaris and bioflocculant-producing bacteria in synthetic wastewater using response surface methodology (RSM), thus aiming to enhance C.vulgaris harvesting and lipid content.

However, the lack of convincing evidence from most informative biomarkers of severe lung dysfunction (SLD-CF) has hampered the formulation of a conclusive, targeted diagnosis of CF. The aim of this study was to determine whether SLD-CF is related to the high concentration of sputum inflammatory mediators and the presence of biofilm-forming bacterial strains. Forty-one patients with advanced CF lung disease were studied. The severity of pulmonary dysfunction was defined by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)<40%. C-reactive protein (CRP) and NLR (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) were examined as representative blood-based markers of inflammation. Expectorated sputum was collected and analysed for cytokines and neutrophil-derived defence proteins. Isolated sputum bacteria were identified and their biofilm-forming capacity was determined. There was no association between FEV1% and total number of sputum bacteria. However, in the high biofilm-forming group the median FEV1 was <40%. Importantly, high density of sputum bacteria was associated with increased concentrations of neutrophil elastase and interleukin (IL)-8 and low concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10. The low concentration of sputum IL-6 is unique for CF and distinct from that observed in other chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. These findings strongly suggest that expectorated sputum is an informative source of pulmonary biomarkers representative for advanced CF and may replace more invasive bronchoalveolar lavage analysis to monitor the disease.

This study evaluated the efficiency (sensitivity related to cost) of the French bovine brucellosis surveillance system using stochastic scenario tree models. Cattle herds were categorized into three risk groups based on the annual number of purchases, given that trading is considered as the main route of brucellosis introduction in cattle herds. The sensitivity in detecting the disease and the costs of the current surveillance system, which includes clinical (abortion) surveillance, programmed serological testing and introduction controls, were compared to those of 19 alternative surveillance scenarios.

To gain an initial insight into BP's mycorrhizal associations, this study examined the rhizobiome of BP and two native plants (Hamelia patens and Bidens alba) across six locations. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with the roots of the target plants and bulk soil was characterized by spore morphotyping. Sequence analysis of metagenomic DNA from lateral roots/rhizosphere of BP (n = 52) and a native shrub H. patens (n = 37) on the same parcel yielded other fungal associates. Overall, the total population of AMF associated with BP was about two folds greater than that of the two native plants (p = 0.0001) growing on the same site. The dominant AMF under Schinus were members of the common Glomus and Rhizophagus spp. By contrast, the most prevalent AMF in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the two Florida native plants, Acaulospora spp (29%) was sharply diminished (9%) under BP rhizosphere. Analysis of the ITS2 sequences also showed that Schinus rhizosphere had a high relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (76.5%) compared to the native H. patens (2.6%), with the species Lactifluus hygrophoroides (Basidiomycota) being the most prevalent at 61.5% (p < 0.05). Unlike the native plants where pathogenic fungi like Phyllosticta sp., Phoma sp., and Neofusicoccum andium were present (8.1% for H. patens), only one potentially pathogenic fungal taxon was detected (3.9%) under BP. The striking disparity in the relative abundance of AMF and other fungal types between BP and the native species is quite significant. Fungal symbionts could aide plant invasion via resource-use efficiency and other poorly defined mechanisms of protection from pathogens in their invaded range.

However, the nature of the relationship between Microcystis and its microbiome remains unclear. Is it a long-term, evolutionarily stable association? Which partners benefit? Here we report the genomic diversity of 109 individual Microcystis colonies-including cyanobacteria and associated bacterial genomes-isolated in situ and without culture from Lake Champlain, Canada and Pampulha Reservoir, Brazil.RESULTS: We identified 14 distinct Microcystis genotypes from Canada, of which only two have been previously reported, and four genotypes specific to Brazil. Microcystis genetic diversity was much greater between than within colonies, consistent with colony growth by clonal expansion rather than aggregation of Microcystis cells. We also identified 72 bacterial species in the microbiome. Each Microcystis genotype had a distinct microbiome composition, and more closely related genotypes had more similar microbiomes. This pattern of phylosymbiosis could be explained by co-phylogeny in only two out of the nine most prevalent associated bacterial genera, Roseomonas and Rhodobacter. These phylogenetically associated genera could enrich the metabolic repertoire of Microcystis, for example by encoding the biosynthesis of complementary carotenoid molecules. In contrast, other colony-associated bacteria showed weaker signals of co-phylogeny, but stronger evidence of horizontal gene transfer with Microcystis. These observations suggest that acquired genes are more likely to be retained in both partners (Microcystis and members of its microbiome) when they are loosely associated, whereas one gene copy is sufficient when the association is physically tight and evolutionarily long-lasting.CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced a method for culture-free isolation of single colonies from nature followed by metagenomic sequencing, which could be applied to other types of microbes. Together, our results expand the known genetic diversity of both Microcystis and its microbiome in natural settings, and support their long-term, specific, and potentially beneficial associations.

This requirement of multiple resistance genes to confer resistance to P. capsici, in chile makes breeding for resistance a daunting pursuit. Against this backdrop, a genetic engineering approach would be to introduce a broad host resistance gene into chile in order to protect it from different races of P. capsici.

The T5-promoter served as a constitutive and homogeneously active control promoter indicating cell viability. wgeA promoter activity was heterogeneous over the whole period of colony development, whereas sinI promoter activity passed through a phase of heterogeneity before becoming homogeneous at late stages. Although quorum sensing-dependent regulation is a major factor activating galactoglucan production, activities of both promoters did not correlate at single cell level. We developed a novel mathematical strategy for classification of the gene expression status in cell populations based on the increase in fluorescence over time in each individual. With respect to galactoglucan biosynthesis, cells in the population were classified into non-contributors, weak contributors, and strong contributors.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,0,1,0,15,0,18,NA,NA,,1873-4863,NA,MEDLINE:25661839,25661839,NA

This study aimed to establish nitrite pathway and enhance N removal via free nitrous acid (FNA)-sediment treatment and Myriophyllum aquaticum vegetation in the CWs treating anaerobically digested swine wastewater.

Among these, bacteriophage therapy, as well as the administration of specific bacteriolysis agents, i.e., lytic enzymes, have emerged as attractive alternatives. Nebulizers offer the possibility for delivering these therapeutics directly to the lung, which is particularly advantageous as a non-invasive and direct route to treat bacterial lung infections. Nevertheless, nebulizers can often result in significant degradation of the bacteriophage or protein, both structurally and functionally, due to the large stresses the aerosolization process imposes on these entities. In this work, we assess the capability of a novel low-cost and portable hybrid surface and bulk acoustic wave platform (HYDRA) to nebulize a Myoviridae bacteriophage (phage K) and lytic enzyme (lysostaphin) that specifically targets Staphylococcus aureus. Besides its efficiency in producing phage or protein-laden aerosols within the 1-5mum respirable range for optimum delivery to the lower respiratory tract where lung infections commonly take place, we observe that the HYDRA platform-owing to the efficiency of driving the aerosolization process at relatively low powers and high frequencies (approximately 10MHz)-does not result in appreciable denaturation of the phages or proteins, such that the loss of antimicrobial activity following nebulization is minimized. Specifically, a low (0.1 log10 (pfu/ml)) titer loss was obtained with the phages, resulting in a high viable respirable fraction of approximately 90%. Similarly, minimal loss of antimicrobial activity was obtained with lysostaphin upon nebulization wherein its minimum inhibitory concentration (0.5 mug/ml) remained unaltered as compared with the non-nebulized control. These results therefore demonstrate the potential of the HYDRA nebulization platform as a promising strategy for pulmonary administration of alternative antimicrobial agents to antibiotics for the treatment of lung diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,NA,NA,,1873-3441,NA,MEDLINE:32315699,32315699,NA

Results: Five out of 201 (2.48%) women show positivity to Brucella, consistent with a past exposition to the infection. All five women delivered healthy infants, but two of them reported previous abortion/stillbirths, with a higher rate than those of the rest of the cohort (40% vs. 21.5%). Conclusions: This is one of the first reports of exposure of pregnant women to Brucella infection in Malawi, providing evidence of Brucella occurrence in an urban setting. Control programs should be introduced to reduce its impact on animal and human health.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,,1557-7759,NA,MEDLINE:35333643,35333643,NA

This study analysed isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a species associated with nosocomial-acquired and community-acquired infections, from hospitals in Germany and Switzerland exhibiting a slight decrease in susceptibility to carbapenems.METHODS: E. coli strains from Germany and Switzerland, obtained mainly in 2019, were first screened for carbapenemase genes by PCR and subsequently whole-genome-sequenced and analysed for their clonal relationship using multilocus sequence typing, single nucleotide polymorphisms, virulence and antibiotic-resistance gene content.RESULTS: The analysis revealed the presence of extended beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli clones producing OXA-244, a point-mutation derivative of OXA-48, with a predominance of isolates exhibiting the sequence type (ST) ST38 in both Germany and Switzerland. These clustered exclusively into two distinct lineages: one encoding CTX-M-27, a recently emerged extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the other CTX-M-14b. All OXA244/CTX-M-27 ST38 isolates harboured the Dr adhesin operon and a representative isolate exhibited a diffuse adherence (DAEC) phenotype and was invasive for Hela cells.CONCLUSION: Clonal lineages of ST38 are members of E. coli phylogenetic group D commonly associated with extra-intestinal infections. Their increased isolation in two different European countries indicates ongoing spread of ST38 ESBL-producing and OXA-244-producing E. coli clonal lineages. It is possible that members of the multidrug-resistant DEAC ExPEC group have expanded globally, but that this is currently underreported because of the inherent difficulty in detecting isolates expressing the OXA-244 allele.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,0,0,0,5,0,9,NA,NA,,1872-7913,NA,MEDLINE:32919009,32919009,NA

The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers has become one of the major agronomic inputs in crop production systems. Strategies to enhance nitrogen assimilation and flux in planta are being pursued through the introduction of novel genetic alleles. Here an Agrobacterium-mediated approach was employed to introduce the alanine aminotransferase from barley (Hordeum vulgare), HvAlaAT, into wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), regulated by either constitutive or root preferred promoter elements. Plants harboring the transgenic HvAlaAT alleles displayed increased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity. The enhanced alt activity impacted height, tillering and significantly boosted vegetative biomass relative to controls in wheat evaluated under hydroponic conditions, where the phenotypic outcome across these parameters varied relative to time of year study was conducted. Constitutive expression of HvAlaAT translated to elevation in wheat grain yield under field conditions. In sorghum, expression of HvAlaAT enhanced enzymatic activity, but no changes in phenotypic outcomes were observed. Taken together these results suggest that positive agronomic outcomes can be achieved through enhanced alt activity in a C3 crop, wheat.

Deletion of SPF1 led to decreased hyphal growth and conidiation, delayed spore germination and appressorium formation, reduced penetration and invasive hyphal extension, and attenuated virulence. Appressorium turgor, however, was not affected by deletion of SPF1.

During predation, myxobacterial cells produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes to kill and consume the prey. It is known that eukaryotic predators, such as ameba and macrophages, introduce copper and other metals into the phagosomes to kill their prey by oxidative stress. However, the role of metals in bacterial predation has not yet been established. In this work, we have addressed the role of copper during predation of M. xanthus on Sinorhizobium meliloti. The use of biosensors, variable pressure scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X ray analysis has revealed that copper accumulates in the region where predator and prey collide. This accumulation of metal up-regulates the expression of several mechanisms involved in copper detoxification in the predator (the P1 B-ATPase CopA, the multicopper oxidase CuoA and the tripartite pump Cus2), and the production by the prey of copper-inducible melanin, which is a polymer with the ability to protect cells from oxidative stress. We have identified two genes in S. meliloti (encoding a tyrosinase and a multicopper oxidase) that participate in the biosynthesis of melanin. Analysis of prey survivability in the co-culture of M. xanthus and a mutant of S. meliloti in which the two genes involved in melanin biosynthesis have been deleted has revealed that this mutant is more sensitive to predation than the wild-type strain. These results indicate that copper plays a role in bacterial predation and that melanin is used by the prey to defend itself from the predator. Taking into consideration that S. meliloti is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium in symbiosis with legumes that coexists in soils with M. xanthus and that copper is a common metal found in this habitat as a consequence of several human activities, these results provide clear evidence that the accumulation of this metal in the soil may influence the microbial ecosystems by affecting bacterial predatory activities.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:32117124,32117124,NA

This genetic and phenotypic change can also be achieved in an experimental evolution scenario on a laboratory time scale using incompatible wild-type strains as inocula.

Genetically encoded biosensors are considered to be promising devices for high-throughput analysis owing to their ability to sense metabolites and couple detection to an actuator, thereby facilitating the rapid detection of small molecules at single-cell level. Here, we review recent advances in the design and engineering of biosensors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and their applications in metabolic engineering. Three types of biosensor are introduced in this review: transcription factor based, RNA-based and enzyme-coupled biosensors. The studies to improve the features of biosensors are also described.

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and site-directed mutagenesis we show here that introducing the mutation S188V into DehE improves substrate specificity towards 3CP. MD simulations showed that residues W34, F37, and S188 of DehE were crucial for substrate binding. DehE showed strong binding ability for D-2-chloropropionic acid (D-2CP) and L-2-chloropropionic acid (L-2CP) but less affinity for 3CP. This reduced affinity was attributed to weak hydrogen bonding between 3CP and residue S188, as the carboxylate of 3CP forms rapidly interconverting hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide and side chain hydroxyl group of S188. By replacing S188 with a valine residue, we reduced the inter-molecular distance and stabilised bonding of the carboxylate of 3CP to hydrogens of the substrate-binding residues. Therefore, the S188V can act on 3CP, although its affinity is less strong than for D-2CP and L-2CP as assessed by Km.

However, antibody DNA sequences can be introduced into plants, and together with laboratory technologies that allow the design of antibodies recognizing any conceivable molecular structure, plants can be used as 'green factories' to produce any antibody at all. The advent of plant-based transient expression systems in particular allows the rapid, convenient, and safe production of antibodies, ranging from laboratory-scale expression to industrial-scale manufacturing. The key features of plant-based production include safety, speed, low cost, and convenience, allowing newcomers to rapidly master the technology and use it to its full advantage. Manufacturing in plants has recently achieved significant milestones and offers more than just an alternative to established microbial and mammalian cell platforms. The use of plants for product development in particular offers the power and flexibility to easily coexpress many different genes, allowing the plug-and-play construction of novel bionanomaterials, perfectly complementing existing approaches based on plant virus-like particles.

The widespread invasiveness of the psyllid vector and HLB in citrus trees worldwide has underscored the need for non-traditional approaches to manage the disease. One tenable solution is through the deployment of RNA interference technology to silence protein-protein interactions essential for ACP-mediated CLas invasion and transmission. To identify psyllid interactor-bacterial effector combinations associated with psyllid-CLas interactions, cDNA libraries were constructed from CLas-infected and CLas-free ACP adults and nymphs, and analyzed for differential expression. Library assemblies comprised 24,039,255 reads and yielded 45,976 consensus contigs. They were annotated (UniProt), classified using Gene Ontology, and subjected to in silico expression analyses using the Transcriptome Computational Workbench (TCW) (http://www.sohomoptera.org/ACPPoP/). Functional-biological pathway interpretations were carried out using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Differentially expressed contigs in adults and/or nymphs represented genes and/or metabolic/pathogenesis pathways involved in adhesion, biofilm formation, development-related, immunity, nutrition, stress, and virulence. Notably, contigs involved in gene silencing and transposon-related responses were documented in a psyllid for the first time. This is the first comparative transcriptomic analysis of ACP adults and nymphs infected and uninfected with CLas.

The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and analysed using qiime ver. 1.8.

We developed a digital PCR-based GMO quantification method to evaluate the GMO content in maize grains.

The R1-nj marker is commonly used in doubled haploid breeding and has improved the efficiency of haploid identification. However, its effectiveness is limited by genetic background and environmental factors. We addressed this technical challenge by developing an efficient and accurate haploid embryo identification marker through co-expression of two transcription factor genes (ZmC1 and ZmR2) driven by the embryo-aleurone-specific bidirectional promoter PZmBD1 ; these factors can activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in the embryo and aleurone layer during early seed development. We developed a new haploid inducer, Maize Anthocyanin Gene InduCer 1 (MAGIC1), by introducing the transgenes into the haploid inducer line CAU6. MAGIC1 could identify haploids at 12days after pollination, which is nine days earlier than CAU6. Importantly, MAGIC1 increased haploid identification accuracy to 99.1%, compared with 88.3% for CAU6. In addition, MAGIC1 could effectively overcome the inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis in some germplasms. Furthermore, an upgraded anthocyanin marker was developed from ZmC1 and ZmR2 to generate MAGIC2, which could identify haploids from diploids due to differential anthocyanin accumulation in immature embryos, coleoptiles, sheaths, roots, leaves, and dry seeds. This haploid identification system is more efficient and accurate than the conventional R1-nj-based method, and it simplifies the haploid identification process.

Next, to improve the level of the precursor malonyl-CoA necessary for naringenin production, we introduced matB and matC from Rhizobium trifolii into C. glutamicum to convert extracellular malonate to intracellular malonyl-CoA. This combinatorial engineering resulted in around 35-fold increase in naringenin production from tyrosine compared to the initial recombinant C. glutamicum. Subsequently, the hpaBC genes from E. coli encoding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase were expressed in C. glutamicum to synthesize eriodictyol from naringenin. Further optimization of the biotransformation process parameters led to the production of 14.10mg/L eriodictyol.CONCLUSIONS: The biosynthesis of the ortho-hydroxylated flavonoid eriodictyol in C. glutamicum was achieved for the first time via functional expression of E. coli hpaBC, providing a baseline strain for biosynthesis of other complex flavonoids. Our study demonstrates the potential application of C. glutamicum as a host microbe for the biosynthesis of value-added natural compounds from tyrosine.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,,1475-2859,NA,MEDLINE:35568867,35568867,NA

Most laboratory accessions and their mutant or transgenic derivatives flower after 4-5 weeks and set seeds after 7-8 weeks, under standard growth conditions (soil, long day, 23 C). Some mutant genotypes, natural accessions, and Arabidopsis relatives require strict control of growth conditions best provided by growth rooms, chambers, or incubators.

In this study, to understand the assembly and fate of endogenous bacteria in rice seeds from the ripening stage to the storage and seedling stages, we employed culture-dependent and metagenomic analyses. Bacterial communities in rice seeds were composed of a few dominant taxa that were introduced at the milky and dough stages, and they persisted during seed maturation. The culturable bacterial population gradually increased during the ripening stage, whereas there was a gradual decrease during storage. Bacteria that persisted during storage proliferated after imbibition and were distributed and established in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings. The storage temperature influenced the abundance of bacteria, which consequently changed the bacterial composition in the shoots and roots of seedlings. Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Allorhizobium were consistently abundant from seed development to the germination stage. Some endogenous bacterial strains significantly promoted the growth of Arabidopsis and rice plants. Overall, our results indicate that rice seeds are colonized by a few bacterial taxa during seed development, and their relative abundance fluctuates during storage and contributes significantly to the establishment of endophytes in the stems and roots of rice plants. The selected bacterial isolates can be used to improve the growth and health of rice plants.

Outcomes included lines with mutations in all or only some of the homoeoalleles of SBE genes and lines in which homoeoalleles carried several different mutations. DNA delivery into protoplasts resulted in mutants with no detectable Cas9 gene, suggesting the absence of foreign DNA. Selected mutants with starch granule abnormalities had reductions in tuber SBE1 and/or SBE2 protein that were broadly in line with expectations from genotype analysis. Strong reduction in both SBE isoforms created an extreme starch phenotype, as reported previously for low-SBE potato tubers. HPLC-SEC and 1 H NMR revealed a decrease in short amylopectin chains, an increase in long chains and a large reduction in branching frequency relative to wild-type starch. Mutants with strong reductions in SBE2 protein alone had near-normal amylopectin chain-length distributions and only small reductions in branching frequency. However, starch granule initiation was enormously increased: cells contained many granules of <4mum and granules with multiple hila. Thus, large reductions in both SBEs reduce amylopectin branching during granule growth, whereas reduction in SBE2 alone primarily affects numbers of starch granule initiations.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has developed into a dedicated bioenergy crop. To improve the biomass production of switchgrass grown on different types of soil, abiotic stress tolerance traits are considered for its genetic improvement. Proline accumulation is a widespread response when plants are subjected to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and salinity. In plants, P5CS gene encodes the key regulatory enzyme that plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis. Here, we introduced the PuP5CS gene (from Puccinellia chinampoensis) into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic lines overexpressing the PuP5CS gene showed phenotypic advantages, in leaf width, internode diameter, internode length, tiller numbers and precocious flowering under normal conditions, and the transgenic lines displayed better regenerative capacity in forming more tillers after harvest. Moreover, the PuP5CS gene enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic switchgrass by altering a wide range of physiological responses. In accordance with the physiological results, histological analysis of cross sections through the leaf blade showed that the areas of bulliform cells and bundle sheath cells were significantly increased in PuP5CS-overexpressing leaves. The expression levels of ROS scavenging-associated genes in transgenic plants were higher than in control plants under salt stress.

Holotrichia parallela (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidae), commonly known as the dark black chafer, is a troublesome pest of soybean (Glycine max). To test whether cry8-like can confer resistance against H. parallela to soybean, we introduced cry8-like from the Bt strain HBF-18 into soybean cultivar Jinong 28.RESULTS: Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that cry8-like was expressed most highly in soybean leaves. In addition, Southern blot assays revealed that one copy of the integrated fragment was present in the transformed plants. Eight independent cry8-like transgenic lines were subsequently fed on by H. parallela. Under H. parallela feeding stress, the survival rates of the non-transgenic plants were 92% lower than those of the transgenic plants. The mortality rate of H. parallela increased when the larvae fed on the roots of T1 transgenic soybean plants. Moreover, the surviving larvae were deformed, and their growth was inhibited.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest that transgenic soybean plants expressing the cry8-like gene are more resistant to H. parallela than non-transgenic plants and that transgenic expression of the cry8-like gene may represent a promising strategy for engineering pest tolerance.

To investigate the gene functions further, sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid was conducted. The results suggested that the gene belongs to the class I KNOX gene (KNOTTED1-like homeobox genes) family and might play important roles in plant development by coding a transcription factor.

Ectopic expression of MtGSTF7 in tt19 mutants could rescue their anthocyanin deficiency, but not their PA defect. Furthermore, PA accumulation was not affected in the mtgstf7 mutants. Taken together, our results show that the mechanism of anthocyanin and PA accumulation in M. truncatula is different from that in A. thaliana, and provide a new target gene for engineering anthocyanins in plants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,,1460-2431,NA,MEDLINE:35294003,35294003,NA

However, multiplex gene coactivation by dCas9-TADs has not been demonstrated in whole plants. There is also room to optimize the performance of these tools. Here, we report that our previously developed gene activator, dCas9-TV, could simultaneously upregulate OsGW7 and OsER1 in rice by up to 3,738 fold, with one sgRNA targeting to each promoter. The gene coactivation could persist to at least the fourth generation. Astonishingly, the polycistronic tRNA-sgRNA expression under the maize ubiquitin promoter, a Pol II promoter, could cause enormous activation of these genes by up to >40,000-fold in rice. Moreover, the yeast GCN4 coiled coil-mediated dCas9-TV dimerization appeared to be promising for enhancing gene activation. Finally, we successfully introduced a self-amplification loop for dCas9-TV expression in Arabidopsis to promote the transcriptional upregulation of AtFLS2, a previously characterized dCas9-TV-refractory gene with considerable basal expression. Collectively, this work illustrates the robustness of dCas9-TV in multigene coactivation and provides broadly useful strategies for boosting transcriptional activation efficacy of dCas9-TADs in plants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,0,0,0,5,0,8,NA,NA,,1744-7909,NA,MEDLINE:33058471,33058471,NA

Whole-genome sequencing analysis of plants transformed with four ABEs, including SpCas9n-TadA8e, SpCas9n-TadA9, SpCas9n-NG-TadA8e, and SpCas9n-NG-TadA9, reveal that ABEs harboring TadA9 lead to a higher number of off-target A-to-G (A>G) single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), and that those harboring CRISPR/SpCas9n-NG lead to a higher total number of off-target SNVs in the rice genome. An analysis of the T-DNAs carrying the ABEs indicates that the on-target mutations could be introduced before and/or after T-DNA integration into plant genomes, with more off-target A>G SNVs forming after the ABEs had integrated into the genome. Furthermore, we detect off-target A>G RNA mutations in plants with high expression of ABEs but not in plants with low expression of ABEs.

A multitude of Vibrio species have been identified as the causative agents. LamB, a member of outer membrane protein (OMPs) family of these bacteria is conserved among all Vibrio species and has been identified as an efficient vaccine candidate against vibriosis. Rootless duckweed (Wolffia) is a tiny, edible aquatic plant possessing characteristics suitable for the utilization as a bioreactor. Thus, we attempted to express a protective edible vaccine antigen against fish vibriosis in nuclear-transformed Wolffia. We amplified LamB gene from virulent Vibrio alginolyticus and it was modified to maximize the protein expression level and translocate the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in plants. It was cloned into binary vector pMYC under the control of CaMV 35S promoter and introduced into Wolffia globosa by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Integration and expression of the LamB gene was confirmed by genomic PCR and RT-PCR. Western blot analysis revealed accumulation of the LamB protein in 8 transgenic lines. The cross-protective property of transgenic Wolffia was evaluated by orally vaccinating zebrafish through feeding fresh transgenic Wolffia and subsequently challenging with virulent V. alginolyticus. High relative percent survival (RPS) of the vaccinated fish (63.3%) confirmed that fish immunized with transgenic Wolffia were well-protected from Vibrio infection. These findings suggest that Wolffia expressed LamB could serve as an edible plant-based candidate vaccine model for fish vibriosis and feasibility of utilizing Wolffia as bioreactor to produce edible vaccines.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,0,0,0,5,0,9,NA,NA,,1664-3224,NA,MEDLINE:32973766,32973766,NA

For a long time, it was not possible to use DSB induction for efficient genome engineering due to the lack of a means to target DSBs to specific sites. This limitation was overcome by development of modified meganucleases and synthetic DNA-binding domains. Domains derived from zinc-finger transcription factors or transcription activator-like effectors may be designed to recognize almost any DNA sequence. By fusing these domains to the endonuclease domains of a classII restriction enzyme, an active endonuclease dimer may be formed that introduces a site-specific DSB. Recent studies demonstrate that gene knockouts via non-homologous end joining or gene modification via homologous recombination are becoming routine in many plant species. By creating a single genomic DSB, complete knockout of a gene, sequence-specific integration of foreign DNA or subtle modification of individual amino acids in a specific protein domain may be achieved. The induction of two or more DSBs allows complex genomic rearrangements such as deletions, inversions or the exchange of chromosome arms. The potential for controlled genome engineering in plants is tremendous. The recently discovered RNA-based CRISPR/Cas system, a new tool to induce multiple DSBs, and sophisticated technical applications, such as the in planta gene targeting system, are further steps in this development.

Conversely, the importance of transient attenuation for the folding, and consequently solubility, of EH was evidenced with a member of the EH family from Agrobacterium radiobacter, which partitions in the soluble fraction when expressed in E. coli.

This forms an extended biotrophic interface enclosing an apoplastic compartment into which fungal effectors can be deployed to evade host detection. M. oryzae also forms a focal, plant membrane-rich structure, the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), that accumulates cytoplasmic effectors for translocation into host cells. Molecular decision-making processes integrating fungal growth and metabolism in host cells with interface function and dynamics are unknown. Here, we report unanticipated roles for the M. oryzae Target-of-Rapamycin (TOR) nutrient-signaling pathway in mediating plant-fungal biotrophic interface membrane integrity. Through a forward genetics screen for M. oryzae mutant strains resistant to the specific TOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin, we discovered IMP1 encoding a novel vacuolar protein required for membrane trafficking, V-ATPase assembly, organelle acidification and autophagy induction. During infection, Deltaimp1 deletants developed intracellular IH in the first infected rice cell following cuticle penetration. However, fluorescently labeled effector probes revealed that interface membrane integrity became compromised as biotrophy progressed, abolishing the BIC and releasing apoplastic effectors into host cytoplasm. Growth between rice cells was restricted. TOR-independent autophagy activation in Deltaimp1 deletants (following infection) remediated interface function and cell-to-cell growth. Autophagy inhibition in wild type (following infection) recapitulated Deltaimp1. In addition to vacuoles, Imp1GFP localized to IH membranes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest TOR-Imp1-autophagy branch signaling mediates membrane homeostasis to prevent catastrophic erosion of the biotrophic interface, thus facilitating fungal growth in living rice cells.

The possibility to access data by third parties is among the most important new introduced within the agreement.OBJECTIVES: Aim of the present report is to improve the know-how on cystic fibrosis (CF) through a better characterization of Italian patients. Furthermore, the present Report aims at improving the care of CF patient. In particular, the Report should contribute to the following objectives: * to analize medium- and long-term clinical and epidemiological trends of the disesase; * to identify the main health care needs at regional and national level in order to contribute to the healthcare programmes and to the distribution of resources; * to compare Italian data with international ones.DESIGN: Analyses and results described in the present Report are referred to patients in charge to the Italian National Referral and Support Centers for Cystic Fibrosis in the period 2015-2016. Data were sent by Centres by means of a specific software (Camilla, Ibis Informatica). Data underwent to a double quality control (QC): the first by NHI and the second at a European level (before the inclusion of the italian data within the European Cystic Fibrosis Registry). These QCs assure the completeness and the accuracy of data as well as their consistency with European core data. Finally, in 2017, an additional CQ was performed to further reduce the number of missing data and consequently improve the precision and the consistency in the nomenclature adopted for genetic mutations.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29 different CF Centres (referral, support, and Paediatric Hospital Bambino Geso) sent their data referred to 2015-2016 years to ICFR . Data regarding Sardinia (Southern Italy) are missing and those from Treviso (Veneto Region, Northern Italy) and Rovereto (Trentino-Alto Adige Region, Northern Italy) are sent through Verona CF Centre.RESULTS: The present Report has been organized into 10 sections. 1. Demography: estimated CF patients is 5,204 in 2015 and 5,362 in 2016; median age is 20.6 and 21.0, respectively. Prevalence is 8.6/100,000 residents in Italy in 2015 and 8.8 in 2016. Male percentage is 51.6% on average for 2015 and 2016; CF distribution showed higher frequency in patients aged from 7 to 35 years. The mean of patients aged more than 18 years is 56.5% on average in 2015 and 2016. 2. Diagnoses: most of the CF patients were diagnosed before 2 years of age (median value: 68%); a significant percentage of patients (median value: 13%) was diagnosed in adult age. 3. New diagnoses: new diagnoses were 169 in 2015 and 153 in 2016. Estimated incidence in 2015 was 1/4,176 living births in 2015 and 1/5,510 in 2016. 4. Genetics: 99.5% of patients underwent genetic analyses and in 96% of patients a mutation in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene was identified. [delta]508F was the most frequent mutation (44,7% in 2016). Furthermore, 16.0% and 3.4% of patients was characterized by the presence of at least one residual function mutation and gating, respectively. Finally, 21% of patients was a stop codons (class 1 mutation) carrier. 5. Lung function: FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second) scores progressively decreased before adult age, in accordance with the natural history of the disease. FEV1% values in patients between 6 and 17 years of age is ≥70%; patients with a FEV1% value of 40% are less than 2% in the period 2015-2016. 6. Nutrition: most critical periods are during the first 6 months of life and during adolescence. Prevalence of malnourished male aged 12-17 years is constant in 2015-2016 and is always more than the prevalence observed in female. An increasing percentage of female patient with a suboptimal BMI value (35.5%) is observed among patients aged more than 18 years 7.COMPLICATIONS: it was estimated that, in 2016, hepatopathies without cirrhosis (17.7%) is the principal complications in patients aged less than 18 years; in patients aged more than 18 years the principal complication was due to hepatopathies without cirrhosis (29.5%) and diabetes (23.3%). 8. Transplantation: in 2015-2016, 74 patients were bipulmunary transplanted; age was comprised between 8 and 52 years, median age at transplantation was 29,6 years. Median waiting times for transplantation is estimated in 17 months (24 months in 2015 and 14 months in 2016). 9. Microbiology: analyses were referred to test performed in 2016. Percentage of adult patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is 52.1% compared to 15.2% of paediatric patients; Staphylococcus aureus infection is present in 53.2% of adult patients and 52.8% of paediatric ones; Burkholderia Cepacia complex is present almost exclusively in adult patients (4.3%); Nontuberculous mycobacteria is present in 1.2% and 0.4% of adult and paediatric patients, respectively; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection is present in the 6.1% of adult patients and 4.9 of paediatric patients. 10.

The result of RT-qPCR for assay of StMAPKs expression demonstrated that 15 StMAPKs were differentially expressed in leaves, flowers, petioles, stamens, pistils, stems, stolons, roots, tubers and tuber peels of potato. StMAPKs was dynamically modulated by abiotic stresses and plant hormone treatments, and StMAPK11 was apparently up-regulated under drought conditions.

The result showed that StMAPK11 promoted potato growth under drought conditions, as well as the physiological activities evidenced by changes in SOD, CAT and POD activity and H2O2, proline and MDA content. StMAPK11 up-regulation intensified drought resistance of potato plant by elevating antioxidant activities and photosynthesis.

Drought stress is one of the most important abiotic stress factors that influence soybean crop quality and yield. Therefore, the creation of drought-tolerant soybean germplasm resources through genetic engineering technology is effective in alleviating drought stress. FvC5SD is a type of C-5 sterol desaturase gene that is obtained from the edible fungus Flammulina velutipes. This gene has good tolerance to the effects of stresses, including drought and low temperature, in yeast cells and tomato. In this study, we introduced the FvC5SD gene into the soybean variety Shennong9 through the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of soybean to identify drought-tolerant transgenic soybean varieties. PCR, RT-PCR, and Southern blot analysis results showed that T-DNA was inserted into the soybean genome and stably inherited by the progeny. The ectopic expression of FvC5SD under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic soybean plants enhanced the plant's tolerance to dehydration and drought. Under drought conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen species and exhibited higher activities and expression levels of enzymes and cell than wild-type soybean. iTRAQ analysis of the comparative proteomics showed that some exogenous genes coding either functional or regulatory proteins were induced in the transgenic lines under drought stress.

We used tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a bipartite begomovirus, to address this issue. Most ToLCNDV isolates are not mechanically transmissible to their natural hosts. The ToLCNDV-OM isolate, originally identified from a diseased oriental melon plant, is mechanically transmissible, while the ToLCNDV-CB isolate, from a diseased cucumber plant, is not. Genetic swapping and pathological tests were performed to identify the molecular determinants involved in mechanical transmission. Various viral infectious clones were constructed and successfully introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana, oriental melon, and cucumber plants by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation. Mechanical transmissibility was assessed via direct rub inoculation with sap prepared from infected N.benthamiana. The presence or absence of viral DNA in plants was validated by PCR, Southern blotting, and in situ hybridization. The results reveal that mechanical transmissibility is associated with the movement protein (MP) of viralDNA-B in ToLCNDV-OM. However, the nuclear shuttle protein of DNA-B plays no role in mechanical transmission. Analyses of infectious clones carrying a single amino acid substitution reveal that the glutamateat amino acid position 19 of MP in ToLCNDV-OM is critical for mechanical transmissibility. The substitution of glutamate with glycine at this position in the MP of ToLCNDV-OM abolishes mechanical transmissibility. In contrast, the substitution of glycine with glutamate at the 19th amino acid position in the MP of ToLCNDV-CB enables mechanical transmission.

The results showed that the presence of a 3' UTR in the CPMV-HT system is important for achieving maximal expression levels. Removal of the entire 3' UTR reduced expression to approximately 30% of that obtained in its presence. It was found that the Y-shaped secondary structure formed by nucleotides 125-165 of the 3' UTR plays a key role in its function; mutations that disrupt this Y-shaped structure have an effect equivalent to the deletion of the entire 3' UTR. Our results suggest that the Y-shaped secondary structure acts by enhancing mRNA accumulation rather than by having a direct effect on RNA translation.

Previously, we generated potato transformants expressing Agrobacterium-derived auxin synthesis gene tms1 driven by tuber-specific patatin gene promoter (B33-promoter). Here, we studied the endogenous hormonal status and the response to exogenous phytohormones in tms1 transformants cultured in vitro. Adding indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or kinetin to culture medium affected differently tuberization of tms1-transformed and control plants, depending also on sucrose content in the medium. Exogenous phytohormones ceased to stimulate the tuber initiation in transformants at high (5-8%) sucrose concentration, while in control plants the stimulation was observed in all experimental settings. Furthermore, exogenous auxin partly inhibited the tuber initiation, and exogenous cytokinin reduced the average tuber weight in most transformants at high sucrose content. The elevated auxin level in tubers of the transformants was accompanied with a decrease in content of cytokinin bases and their ribosides in tubers and most shoots. No concerted changes in contents of abscisic, jasmonic, salicylic acids and gibberellins in tubers were detected. The data on hormonal status indicated that the enhanced productivity of tms1 transformants was due to auxin and not mediated by other phytohormones. In addition, exogenous cytokinin was shown to upregulate the expression of genes encoding orthologs of auxin receptors. Overall, the results showed that tms1 expression and local increase in IAA level in transformants affect both the balance of endogenous cytokinins and the dynamics of tuberization in response to exogenous hormones (auxin, cytokinin), the latter reaction depending also on the carbohydrate supply.

The T-DNA region carries iaaM and iaaH genes for synthesis of the plant hormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). It has been demonstrated that the iaaM gene encodes a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide (IAM), and the iaaH gene encodes an amidase for subsequent conversion of IAM to IAA. In this article, we demonstrate that A. tumefaciens enhances the production of both IAA and phenylacetic acid (PAA), another auxin which does not show polar transport characteristics, in the formation of crown galls. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, we found that the endogenous levels of phenylacetamide (PAM) and PAA metabolites, as well as IAM and IAA metabolites, are remarkably increased in crown galls formed on the stem of tomato plants, implying that two distinct auxins are simultaneously synthesized via the IaaM-IaaH pathway. Moreover, we found that the induction of the iaaM gene dramatically elevated the levels of PAM, PAA and its metabolites, along with IAM, IAA and its metabolites, in Arabidopsis and barley.

For proof of concept, the sequence of acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCase) from creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) was altered with synonymous mutations. A native bentgrass ACCase was cloned and used as a template for the modified gene.

Dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs) are important plant transcription factors that regulate the expression of many stress-inducible genes and play a critical role in improving the abiotic stress tolerance. Transgenic chickpea lines harbouring transcription factor, Dehydration Responsive Element-Binding protein 1A from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtDREB1a gene) driven by stress inducible promoter rd29a were developed, with the intent of enhancing drought tolerance in chickpea. Performance of the progenies of one transgenic event and control were assessed based on key physiological traits imparting drought tolerance such as plant water relation characteristics, chlorophyll retention, photosynthesis, membrane stability and water use efficiency under water stressed conditions.RESULTS: Four transgenic chickpea lines harbouring stress inducible AtDREB1a were generated with transformation efficiency of 0.1%. The integration, transmission and regulated expression were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Southern Blot hybridization and Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Transgenic chickpea lines exhibited higher relative water content, longer chlorophyll retention capacity and higher osmotic adjustment under severe drought stress (stress level 4), as compared to control. The enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic chickpea lines were also manifested by undeterred photosynthesis involving enhanced quantum yield of PSII, electron transport rate at saturated irradiance levels and maintaining higher relative water content in leaves under relatively severe soil water deficit. Further, lower values of carbon isotope discrimination in some transgenic chickpea lines indicated higher water use efficiency. Transgenic chickpea lines exhibiting better OA resulted in higher seed yield, with progressive increase in water stress, as compared to control.CONCLUSIONS: Based on precise phenotyping, involving non-invasive chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, carbon isotope discrimination, osmotic adjustment, higher chlorophyll retention and membrane stability index, it can be concluded that AtDREB1a transgenic chickpea lines were better adapted to water deficit by modifying important physiological traits. The selected transgenic chickpea event would be a valuable resource that can be used in pre-breeding or directly in varietal development programs for enhanced drought tolerance under parched conditions.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,0,0,2,0,5,NA,NA,,1471-2229,NA,MEDLINE:33430800,33430800,NA

Its overexpression in Camelina sativa effectively alters plant development and terpenoid metabolism. Geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) converts one isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to GPP. Here, we report a synthetic insect-plant GPPS gene and effects of its overexpression on plant growth and terpenoid metabolism of Camelina sativa. We synthesized a 1353-bp cDNA, namely PTP-MpGPPS. This synthetic cDNA was composed of a 1086-bp cDNA fragment encoding a small GPPS isomer of the aphid Myzus persicae (Mp), 240-bp Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA fragment encoding a plastidial transit peptide (PTP), and a 27-bp short cDNA fragment encoding a human influenza hemagglutinin tag peptide. Structural modeling showed that the deduced protein was a homodimeric prenyltransferase. Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that the PTP-MpGPPS fused with green florescent protein was localized in the plastids. The synthetic PTP-MpGPPS cDNA driven by 2*35S promoters was introduced into Camelina (Camelina sativa) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and its overexpression in transgenic plants were demonstrated by western blot. T2 and T3 progeny of transgenic plants developed larger leaves, grew more and longer internodes, and flowered earlier than wild-type plants. Metabolic analysis showed that the levels of beta-amyrin and campesterol were higher in tissues of transgenic plants than in those of wild-type plants. Fast isoprene sensor analysis demonstrated that transgenic Camelina plants emitted significantly less isoprene than wild-type plants. In addition, transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression levels of gibberellic acid and brassinosteroids-responsive genes were higher in transgenic plants than in wild-type plants. Taken together, these data demonstrated that this novel synthetic insect-plant GPPS cDNA was effective to improve growth traits and alter terpenoid metabolism of Camelina.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13,2,0,0,13,0,16,NA,NA,,1432-2048,NA,MEDLINE:27023458,27023458,NA

Gene conversion in the nitrogenase (nifH) multigene family of Rhizobium etli was analyzed by using a two-plasmid system, where each plasmid carried a copy of nifH. One of the nifH copies was modified, creating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) spaced along the gene. Once the modified plasmid was introduced into R. etli, selection was done for cointegration with a resident plasmid lacking the RFLPs. Most of the cointegrate molecules harbor gene conversion events, biased toward a gain of RFLPs. This bias may be explained under the double-strand break repair model by proposing that the nifH gene lacking the RFLPs suffers a DNA double-strand break, so the incoming plasmid functions as a template for repairing the homolog on the resident plasmid. To support this proposal, we cloned an SceI site into the nifH homolog that had the RFLPs used for scoring gene conversion. In vivo expression of the meganuclease I-SceI allowed the generation of a double-strand break on this homolog. Upon introduction of this modified plasmid into an R. etli strain lacking I-SceI, biased gene conversion still favored the retention of markers on the incoming plasmid. In contrast, when the recipient strain ectopically expressed I-SceI, a dramatic reversal in gene conversion bias was seen, favoring the preservation of resident sequences. These results show that biased gene conversion is caused by preferential double-strand breaks on one of the recombining homologs.IMPORTANCE: In this work, we analyzed gene conversion by using a system that entails horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination in the recipient cell. Most gene conversion events are biased toward the acquisition of the incoming sequences, ranging in size from 120 bp to 800 bp. This bias is due to preferential cutting of resident DNA and can be reversed upon introduction of a double-strand break on the incoming sequence. Since conditions used in this work are similar to those in horizontal gene transfer, it provides evidence that, upon transfer, the resident DNA preferentially acquires gene variants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,NA,NA,,1098-5530,NA,MEDLINE:26598365,26598365,NA

Increased grain yields due to the soil fertility treatments was evident for 99% target farmers. On average, I and P increased grain yield by 21% and 25% respectively, while the combined application of I and P resulted in a 38% increase. However, observed grain yields on control plots and responses to the treatments on individual farms varied greatly, and relative yield responses (%; yield of P and/I minus control yield, divided by control yield) ranged from 3% to 138%. With the exception of a few extremely poorly yielding locations, average responses to P and I were high across a wide range of control yields, indicating the possibility of boosting chickpea productivity for smallholders with P fertilizer and inoculant technology. Variation in response to rhizobium inoculation was mostly independent of agro-ecology and soil type although it was found to be low on a number of farms with extremely high N contents (%).

The early stages of this association involve a complex of signalling events between the host and microsymbiont. Several genes dealing with early signal transduction have been cloned, and one of them encodes the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase (SymRK; also termed NORK). The Symbiosis Receptor Kinase gene is required by legumes to establish a root endosymbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria as well as mycorrhizal fungi. Using degenerate primer and BAC sequencing, we cloned duplicated SymRK homeologues in soybean called GmSymRKalpha and GmSymRKbeta. These duplicated genes have high similarity of nucleotide (96%) and amino acid sequence (95%). Sequence analysis predicted a malectin-like domain within the extracellular domain of both genes. Several putative cis-acting elements were found in promoter regions of GmSymRKalpha and GmSymRKbeta, suggesting a participation in lateral root development, cell division and peribacteroid membrane formation. The mutant of SymRK genes is not available in soybean; therefore, to know the functions of these genes, RNA interference (RNAi) of these duplicated genes was performed. For this purpose, RNAi construct of each gene was generated and introduced into the soybean genome by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root transformation. RNAi of GmSymRKbeta gene resulted in an increased reduction of nodulation and mycorrhizal infection than RNAi of GmSymRKalpha, suggesting it has the major activity of the duplicated gene pair.

Viruses can act as extracellular reservoirs of bacterial genes, can mediate microbiome dynamics, and can influence the virulence of clinical pathogens. Various targeted metagenomic analysis techniques detect viral sequences, but these methods often exclude large and genome integrated viruses. In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of nine state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools, including Vibrant, VirSorter, VirSorter2, VirFinder, DeepVirFinder, MetaPhinder, Kraken 2, Phybrid, and a BLAST search using identified proteins from the Earth Virome Pipeline to identify viral contiguous sequences (contigs) across simulated metagenomes with different read distributions, taxonomic compositions, and complexities.RESULTS: Of the tools tested in this study, VirSorter achieved the best F1 score while Vibrant had the highest average F1 score at predicting integrated prophages. Though less balanced in its precision and recall, Kraken2 had the highest average precision by a substantial margin. We introduced the machine learning tool, Phybrid, which demonstrated an improvement in average F1 score over tools such as MetaPhinder. The tool utilizes machine learning with both gene content and nucleotide features. The addition of nucleotide features improves the precision and recall compared to the gene content features alone.Viral identification by all tools was not impacted by underlying read distribution but did improve with contig length. Tool performance was inversely related to taxonomic complexity and varied by the phage host. For instance, Rhizobium and Enterococcus phages were identified consistently by the tools; whereas, Neisseria prophage sequences were commonly missed in this study.CONCLUSION: This study benchmarked the performance of nine state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools to identify viral contigs across different simulation conditions. This study explored the ability of the tools to identify integrated prophage elements traditionally excluded from targeted sequencing approaches.

However, a rapid trait testing system for canola requires the development of an efficient transformation and tissue culture system for B. napus-RC. Furthermore, effectiveness of this system needs to be demonstrated by showing that a particular trait can be rapidly introduced into B. napus-RC plants.RESULTS: An in-vitro regeneration protocol was developed for B. napus-RC using 4-day-old cotyledons as the explant. High regeneration percentages, exceeding 70%, were achieved when 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (0.10mg/L), 6-benzylaminopurine (1.0mg/L), gibberellic acid (0.01mg/L) and the ethylene antagonist silver nitrate (5mg/L) were included in the regeneration medium. An average transformation efficiency of 16.4% was obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of B. napus-RC cotyledons using Agrobacterium strain GV3101 harbouring a plasmid with an NPTII (kanamycin-selectable) marker gene and the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN6 (AtACBP6). Transgenic B. napus-RC overexpressing AtACBP6 displayed better tolerance to freezing/frost than the wild type, with enhanced recovery from cellular membrane damage at both vegetative and flowering stages. AtACBP6-overexpressing B. napus-RC plants also exhibited lower electrolyte leakage and improved recovery following frost treatment, resulting in higher yields than the wild type. Ovules from transgenic AtACBP6 lines were better protected from frost than those of the wild type, while the developing embryos of frost-treated AtACBP6-overexpressing plants showed less freezing injury than the wild type.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that B. napus-RC can be successfully regenerated and transformed from cotyledon explants and has the potential to be an effective trait testing platform for canola.

Here, we extend the transformation-associated recombination cloning and heterologous expression platform for microbial BGCs to include Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts. Using a broad-host-range expression platform, we test the implicit assumption that biosynthetic pathways are more successfully expressed in more closely related heterologous hosts. Cloning and expression of the violacein BGC from Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea 2ta16 revealed robust production in two proteobacterial hosts, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404, but very little production of the antibiotic in various laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, despite their closer phylogenetic relationship. We identified a nonclustered LuxR-type quorum-sensing receptor from P.luteoviolacea 2ta16, PviR, that increases pathway transcription and violacein production in E.coli by 60-fold independently of acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers. Although E.coli harbors the most similar homolog of PviR identified from all of the hosts tested, overexpression of various E.coli transcription factors did not result in a statistically significant increase in violacein production, while overexpression of two A.tumefaciens PviR homologs significantly increased production. Thus, this work not only introduces a new genetic platform for the heterologous expression of microbial BGCs, it also challenges the assumption that host phylogeny is an accurate predictor of host compatibility.IMPORTANCE Although Gram-positive heterologous hosts such as Streptomyces have been developed and optimized to support diverse secondary metabolic reactions, there has been comparatively less work on Gram-negative hosts, some of which grow faster and are easier to work with. This work presents a new genetic platform for direct cloning and broad-host-range heterologous expression of BGCs in Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts, and we leverage this platform to uncover regulatory elements that influence violacein expression from Pseudoalteromonas Although it is often assumed that BGCs will be more successfully expressed in more closely related hosts, our work suggests that this may not be a general rule of thumb, as heterologous production of natural products can be influenced by specific host regulatory and/or biosynthetic elements, and the identity and effectiveness of those elements are difficult to predict. We argue for the use of a diverse set of heterologous hosts, which may also provide insights into the BGC biosynthetic mechanism and the biological function of BGCs.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36,1,0,0,30,1,36,NA,NA,,2150-7511,NA,MEDLINE:28874475,28874475,NA

Microbiota-mediated pathogen response in the soil-root interface may hold the key for microbiome-based control strategies of phytopathogens. We studied the pathosystem sugar beet-late sugar beet root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani in an integrative design of combining in vitro and in vivo (greenhouse and field) trials. We used five different cultivars originating from two propagation sites (France, Italy) with different degrees of susceptibility towards R. solani (two susceptible, one moderately tolerant and two cultivars with partial resistance). Analyzing bacterial communities in seeds and roots grown under different conditions by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we found site-, cultivar-, and microhabitat-specific amplicon sequences variants (ASV) as well as a seed core microbiome shared between all sugar beet cultivars (121 ASVs representing 80%-91% relative abundance). In general, cultivar-specific differences in the bacterial communities were more pronounced in seeds than in roots. Seeds of Rhizoctonia-tolerant cultivars contain a higher relative abundance of the genera Paenibacillus, Kosakonia, and Enterobacter, while Gaiellales, Rhizobiales, and Kosakonia were enhanced in responsive rhizospheres. These results indicate a correlation between bacterial seed endophytes and Rhizoctonia-tolerant cultivars. Root communities are mainly substrate-derived but also comprise taxa exclusively derived from seeds. Interestingly, the signature of Pseudomonas poae Re*1-1-14, a well-studied sugar-beet specific biocontrol agent, was frequently found and in higher relative abundances in Rhizoctonia-tolerant than in susceptible cultivars. For microbiome management, we introduced microbial inoculants (consortia) and microbiome transplants (vermicompost) in greenhouse and field trials; both can modulate the rhizosphere and mediate tolerance towards late sugar beet root rot. Both, seeds and soil, provide specific beneficial bacteria for rhizosphere assembly and microbiota-mediated pathogen tolerance.

Expression patterns were assessed using the beta-glucuronidase gene GUSPlus and X-glucuronide staining. All three promoters showed strong expression levels in stem tissue at the base of internodes where cell wall deposition is most active, in both vascular bundle xylem vessels and tracheids, and in interfascicular tissues, with expression less pronounced in developmentally older tissues. In leaves, BdCESA7 and BdCESA8 promoter-driven expression was strongest in leaf veins, leaf margins, and trichomes; relatively weaker and patchy expression was observed in the epidermis. BdPMT promoter-driven expression was similar to the BdCESA promoters expression patterns, including strong expression in trichomes.

We used next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to study environmental fate of Bacillus subtilis, a widely used BCA, focusing on its dispersal aspect in open field and under protection. The dispersal of B. subtilis was very limited, particularly under protection. The reduction in the BCA population size was relatively small within 8 days; indeed, no overall reduction in the relative abundance was observed under the protected condition. These results suggested that limited dispersal is probably the main reason for its variable (and often low) control efficacy under field conditions.

At that time the gene expression patterns of host plants differ depending on the Agrobacterium strain, plant species and cell-type used. Later on, integration of the T-DNA into the plant host genome, expression of the encoded oncogenes, and increase in phytohormone levels induce a fundamental reprogramming of the transformed cells. This results in their proliferation and finally formation of plant tumors. The process of reprogramming is accompanied by altered gene expression, morphology and metabolism.

This review summarizes the current knowledge about plant responses in the course of tumor development. Special emphasis is placed on the connection between epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and morphological changes in the developing tumor.

And the positive relationship between the levels of AtABF3 gene expression and drought-tolerance was confirmed by qRT-PCR and drought tolerance test. The stronger drought tolerance of transgenic lines seemed to be resulted from physiological changes. Transgenic lines #2 and #9 showed ion leakage at a significantly lower level (P < 0.01) than non-transgenic (NT) control. In addition, the chlorophyll contents of the leaves of transgenic lines were significantly higher (P < 0.01).

Water loss by transpiration also slowly proceeded in transgenic plants. In microscopic observation, higher stomata closure was confirmed in transgenic lines. Especially, line #9 had 56% of completely closed stomata whereas only 16% were completely open.

We therefore measured phenotypic variation in natural rhizobia populations and investigated how PHB might contribute to fitness in the free-living stage. We found that natural populations of rhizobia from Glycine max and Chamaecrista fasciculata had substantial, heritable variation in PHB acquisition during symbiosis. A model simulating temperature-dependent metabolic activity showed that the observed range of stored PHB per cell could support survival for a few days, for active cells, or over a century for sufficiently dormant cells.

In this study, we evaluated the endophytic bacterial diversity retrieved using different mDNA extraction procedures. Metagenomic DNA from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) stem and root tissues were extracted using two classical DNA extraction protocols (CTAB- and SDS-based) and five commercial kits. The mDNA yields and quality as well as the reproducibility were compared. 16S rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) was used to assess the impact on endophytic bacterial community structures observed. Generally, the classical protocols obtained high mDNA yields from sorghum tissues; however, they were less reproducible than the commercial kits. Commercial kits retrieved higher quality mDNA, but with lower endophytic bacterial diversities compared to classical protocols. The SDS-based protocol enabled access to the highest sorghum endophytic diversities. Therefore, SDS-extracted sorghum root and stem microbiome diversities were analysed via 454 pyrosequencing, and this revealed that the two tissues harbour significantly different endophytic communities.

Here, we introduced synonymous substitutions to the codon C574G575C576 coding conserved residue arginine at position 192 (R192) of tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV) CP. Substitution of the codon C574G575C576 to A574G575A576 or A574G575G576, but not C574G575A576, C574G575T576, or C574G575G576, reduced the replication, cell-to-cell movement, and accumulation of TVBMV in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, suggesting that C574 was critical for replication of TVBMV. Nucleotides 531 to 576 of the TVBMV CP-coding sequence were predicted to form a stem-loop structure, in which four consecutive C-G base pairs (C576-G531, C532-G575, C574-G533, and C534-G573) were located at the stem.

Synonymous substitutions disrupting base pairs C576-G531 and C534-G573 did not affect viral accumulation. After three serial-passage inoculations, the accumulation of spontaneous mutant viruses was restored, and codons A532G533A534, A532G533G534, A574G575A576, or A574G575G576 of mutants were each separately changed to C532G533A534, C532G533G534, C574G575A576, or C574G575G576.

Stored product mites (Astigmata) often establish large populations in various types of food items, damaging the food by direct feeding and introducing contaminants, including their own bodies, allergen-containing feces, and associated microorganisms. Here we access the microbial structure and abundance in rearing diets, eggs, feces fraction, and mite bodies of 16 mite populations belonging to three species (Carpoglyphus lactis, Acarus siro, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae) using quantitative PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing. The mite microbiomes had a complex structure dominated by the following bacterial taxa (OTUs): (a) intracellular symbionts of the genera Cardinium and Wolbachia in the mite bodies and eggs; (b) putative gut symbionts of the genera Solitalea, Bartonella, and Sodalis abundant in mite bodies and also present in mite feces; (c) feces-associated or environmental bacteria of the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Kocuria in the diet, mite bodies, and feces. Interestingly and counterintuitively, the differences between microbial communities in various conspecific mite populations were higher than those between different mite species. To explain some of these differences, we hypothesize that the intracellular bacterial symbionts can affect microbiome composition in mite bodies, causing differences between microbial profiles. Microbial profiles differed between various sample types, such as mite eggs, bodies, and the environment (spent growth medium-SPGM). Low bacterial abundances in eggs may result in stochastic effects in parent-offspring microbial transmission, except for the intracellular symbionts. Bacteria in the rearing diet had little effect on the microbial community structure in SPGM and mite bodies. Mite fitness was positively correlated with bacterial abundance in SPGM and negatively correlated with bacterial abundances in mite bodies. Our study demonstrates critical host-microbe interactions, affecting all stages of mite growth and leading to alteration of the environmental microbiome.

However, the limited availability of promoter sequences that are uniquely active in specific tissue-types and/or at specific times often precludes co-expression of multiple transgenes in precisely controlled developmental contexts. Here, we developed a system for use in rice that comprises synthetic designer transcription activator-like effectors (dTALEs) and cognate synthetic TALE-activated promoters (STAPs). The system allows multiple transgenes to be expressed from different STAPs, with the spatial and temporal context determined by a single promoter that drives expression of the dTALE. We show that two different systems-dTALE1-STAP1 and dTALE2-STAP2-can activate STAP-driven reporter gene expression in stable transgenic rice lines, with transgene transcript levels dependent on both dTALE and STAP sequence identities. The relative strength of individual STAP sequences is consistent between dTALE1 and dTALE2 systems but differs between cell-types, requiring empirical evaluation in each case. dTALE expression leads to off-target activation of endogenous genes but the number of genes affected is substantially less than the number impacted by the somaclonal variation that occurs during the regeneration of transformed plants. With the potential to design fully orthogonal dTALEs for any genome of interest, the dTALE-STAP system thus provides a powerful approach to fine-tune the expression of multiple transgenes, and to simultaneously introduce different synthetic circuits into distinct developmental contexts.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,,1467-7652,NA,MEDLINE:35639605,35639605,NA

The results showed that 20 miRNAs were modulated, of which, 12 were upregulated and 8 were downregulated. These findings were corroborated by RT-qPCR, and ROC curves indicated that the miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for Brucella.

In 2006, a study of the variability of TYLCV in DO revealed that TYLCV-IL[DO] was associated with all samples of tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) tested and, thus, that the virus had been genetically stable for >15 years (2). However, in 2010 and 2011, 2 of 10 and 11 of 18 samples of TYLC, respectively, were negative for TYLCV infection based upon PCR with the TYLCV-specific primer pair, 2560v (5'-GAGAACAATTGGGATATG-3')/1480c (5'-AATCATGGATTCACGCAC-3'), which directs the amplification of a ~1.7 kb fragment. In 2011, two such samples from the Azua Valley were tested by PCR with the 1470v (5'-AGTGATGAGTTCCCCTGTGC-3')/UPC2 primer pair (1), and sequence analysis of the ~0.4 kb fragment amplified from both samples revealed infection with the mild strain of TYLCV (TYLCV-Mld). A primer specific for TYLCV-Mld was designed (2070v, 5'-AAACGGAGAAATATATAAGGAGCC-3'), and PCR with the 2070v/1480c primer pair directed the amplification of the expected ~2.1 kb fragment from all 11 TYLC samples collected in 2011 that were PCR-negative for TYLCV-IL[DO] infection. Sequence analyses confirmed these were TYLCV-Mld fragments. The complete TYLCV-Mld genome was amplified from two samples from the Azua Valley with Templiphi, the amplified DNA products digested with Sal I, and the resulting ~2.8 kb fragments ligated into Sal I-digested pGEM-11. The complete sequences of these isolates were 2,791 nt and 99% identical to each other and 98% identical to sequences of TYLCV-Mld isolates. The TYLCV-Mld isolates from the DO were designated TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:01:2011 (KJ913682) and TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:02:2011 (KJ913683). A multimeric clone of TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:01:2011 was generated in the binary vector pCAMBIA1300 by cloning a 2.2 kb Sal I-EcoRI fragment containing the intergenic region to generate a 0.8-mer (pCTYMld0.8), and then the full-length Sal I fragment was cloned into the Sal I site of pCTYMld0.8 to generate a 1.8-mer (pCTYMldDO-01-1.8). Tomato plants agroinoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pCTYMldDO-01-1.8 developed severe TYLC disease symptoms 10 to 14 days after inoculation, whereas plants inoculated with a strain carrying the empty vector did not develop symptoms. Samples of processing tomatoes with TYLC were collected in 2012 to 2014 in the DO and tested for TYLCV-IL[DO] and TYLCV-Mld by PCR with the 2560v/1480c and 2070v/1480c primers pairs, respectively; these samples had infections of 93% (13/14), 86% (18/21), and 61% (11/18) with TYLCV-Mld; 29% (4/14), 19% (4/21), and 56% (10/18) with TYLCV-IL[DO]; and 21% (3/14), 5% (1/21), and 28% (5/18) with both viruses, respectively. These results reveal that there has been a striking population shift in the begomovirus causing TYLC in the DO, with TYLCV-Mld becoming predominant. This may reflect selection pressure(s) favoring a small pre-existing population of TYLCV-Mld, such as new tomato varieties, or a recent introduction event, such as that described in Venezuela (4).

The transgenic tomato displayed much greater anthocyanin accumulation than wild type in all plant organs, but the organs were not fully purple in color except for the stamen. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and an anthocyanin-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene SlAN1 was significantly increased in the transgenic line, suggesting that ectopic expression of AtPAP2 increases the expression of anthocyanin-related structural and regulatory genes to enhance anthocyanin content. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the endogenous MYB protein SlAN2 interacted with two putative bHLH partners, SlAN1 and SlJAF13, while AtPAP2 only interacted with SlJAF13, which may be why AtPAP2 transgenic plants showed limited anthocyanin accumulation in fruits. In addition to anthocyanin accumulation, the transgenic tomato plants were significantly smaller in size, and the length of primary roots and number of lateral roots were obviously decreased. The expression of lignin biosynthetic genes was downregulated in transgenic tomato plants, which may be the reason for the inhibited growth. The lateral organ boundaries-domain (LBD) genes, which regulate lateral root organogenesis in the auxin signaling pathway, were downregulated in transgenic tomato roots, which may partly account for the disturbed lateral root formation in the transformants.

As a major legume forage, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) contains little proanthocyanidins in foliage to combat bloat. In an attempt to improve proanthocyanidin content in alfalfa foliage, we over-expressed two MYB transcription factors (CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2) from tea plant that is rich in proanthocyanidins. We showed that, via targeted metabolite and transcript analyses, the transgenic alfalfa plants accumulated higher levels of flavonoids in stems/leaves than the control, in particular anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Over-expression of CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2 induced the expression levels of genes involved in flavonoid pathway, especially anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin-specific pathway genes DFR, ANS and ANR in stems/leaves. Both anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin content and the expression levels of several genes were conversely decreased in flowers of the transgenic lines than in control.

The NSs protein is an RNA silencing suppressor in orthotospoviruses, such as the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). The mechanism of RNA silencing suppression by NSs and its role in virus infection and movement are poorly understood. Here, we cloned and tagged TSWV NSs and expressed it from a GFP-tagged turnip mosaic virus (TuMV-GFP) carrying either a wild-type or suppressor-deficient (AS9) helper component proteinase (HC-Pro). When expressed in cis, NSs restored pathogenicity and promoted systemic infection of suppressor-deficient TuMV-AS9-GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivating mutations were introduced in NSs RNA-binding domain one. A genetic analysis with active and suppressor-deficient NSs, in combination with wild-type and mutant plants lacking essential components of the RNA silencing machinery, showed that the NSs insert is stable when expressed from a potyvirus. NSs can functionally replace potyviral HC-Pro, condition virus susceptibility, and promote systemic infection and symptom development by suppressing antiviral RNA silencing through a mechanism that partially overlaps that of potyviral HC-Pro.

Secondary metabolites are formed from large synthase/synthetase enzymes often encoded in gene clusters containing additional enzymes cooperating in the metabolite's biosynthesis. The true potential of fungal metabolomes remain untapped as the majority of secondary metabolite gene clusters are silent under standard laboratory growth conditions. One way to achieve expression of biosynthetic pathways is to clone the responsible genes and express them in a well-suited heterologous host, which poses a challenge since Fusarium polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters can be large (e.g. as large as 80 kb) and comprise several genes necessary for product formation. The major challenge associated with heterologous expression of fungal biosynthesis pathways is thus handling and cloning large DNA sequences. In this paper we present the successful workflow for cloning, reconstruction and heterologous production of two previously characterized Fusarium pseudograminearum natural product pathways in Fusarium graminearum. In vivo yeast recombination enabled rapid assembly of the W493 (NRPS32-PKS40) and the Fusarium Cytokinin gene clusters. F. graminearum transformants were obtained through protoplast-mediated and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Whole genome sequencing revealed isolation of transformants carrying intact copies the gene clusters was possible. Known Fusarium cytokinin metabolites; fusatin, 8-oxo-fusatin, 8-oxo-isopentenyladenine, fusatinic acid together with cis- and trans-zeatin were detected by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which confirmed gene functionality in F. graminearum. In addition the non-ribosomal lipopeptide products W493 A and B was heterologously produced in similar amounts to that observed in the F. pseudograminearum doner. The Fusarium pan-genome comprises more than 60 uncharacterized putative secondary metabolite gene clusters. We nominate the well-characterized F. graminearum as a heterologous expression platform for Fusarium secondary metabolite gene clusters, and present our experience cloning and introducing gene clusters into this species.

As each of these transport steps might potentially be limiting to efficient nitrogen delivery to the pea embryo, we manipulated both simultaneously. Additional copies of the pea amino acid permease PsAAP1 were introduced into the pea genome and expression of the transporter was targeted to the sieve element-companion cell complexes of the leaf phloem and to the epidermis of the seed cotyledons. The transgenic pea plants showed increased phloem loading and embryo loading of amino acids resulting in improved long distance transport of nitrogen, sink development and seed protein accumulation. Analyses of root and leaf tissues further revealed that genetic manipulation positively affected root nitrogen uptake, as well as primary source and sink metabolism.

Despite their economic, cultural, and ecological importance, very little research has been conducted on the viral community that infects them. We previously identified a highly divergent geminivirus that is the first known to infect cacti. Recent research efforts in non-cultivated and asymptomatic plants have shown that the diversity of this viral family has been under-sampled. As a consequence, little is known about the effects and interactions of geminiviruses in many plants, such as cacti. With the objective to expand knowledge on the diversity of geminiviruses infecting cacti, we used previously acquired high-throughput sequencing results to search for viral sequences using BLASTx against a viral RefSeq protein database. We identified two additional sequences with similarity to geminiviruses, for which we designed abutting primers and recovered full-length genomes. From 42 cacti and five scale insects, we derived 42 complete genome sequences of a novel geminivirus species that we have tentatively named Opuntia virus 2 (OpV2) and 32 genomes of an Opuntia-infecting becurtovirus (which is a new strain of the spinach curly top Arizona virus species). Interspecies recombination analysis of the OpV2 group revealed several recombinant regions, in some cases spanning half of the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that OpV2 is a novel geminivirus more closely related to viruses of the genus Curtovirus, which was further supported by the detection of three recombination events between curtoviruses and OpV2. Both OpV2 and Opuntia becurtoviruses were identified in mixed infections, which also included the previously characterized Opuntia virus 1. Viral quantification of the co-infected cactus plants compared with single infections did not show any clear trend in viral dynamics that might be associated with the mixed infections. Using experimental Rhizobium-mediated inoculations, we found that the initial accumulation of OpV2 is facilitated by co-infection with OpV1. This study shows that the diversity of geminiviruses that infect cacti is under-sampled and that cacti harbor diverse geminiviruses. The detection of the Opuntia becurtoviruses suggests spill-over events between viruses of cultivated species and native vegetation. The threat this poses to cacti needs to be further investigated.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,NA,NA,,1999-4915,NA,MEDLINE:33923787,33923787,NA

The increased demand will need to be fulfilled by the two main sources of N supply - biological nitrogen (gas) (N2) fixation (BNF) and fertilizer N supplied through the Haber-Bosch processes. BNF provides many functional benefits for agroecosystems. It is a vital mechanism for replenishing the reservoirs of soil organic N and improving the availability of soil N to support crop growth while also assisting in efforts to lower negative environmental externalities than fertilizer N.

It has been successfully controlled in many developed countries by using vaccination in conjunction with extensive surveillance and test-and-cull approaches, but some of these approaches do not suit Indian culture and norms. This study was conducted to investigate the feasibility and social acceptability of various bovine brucellosis control strategies in India. Focus group discussions and key-informant interviews were conducted with veterinarians, para-veterinarians, veterinary academics, farmers and other stakeholders. Vaccination with the Brucella strain 19 vaccine was considered feasible, but the participants were concerned about the risk of self-inoculation, the inability to vaccinate pregnant and male animals, the difficulty to differentiate vaccinated from diseased animals and the challenges of maintaining the vaccine cold chain in India. As expected, the test-and-cull approach was not considered feasible as cattle are considered sacred by Hindus and their slaughter is banned in most states. Although the test-and-segregation approach appears reasonable in theory, it would have low acceptability, if implemented without providing any compensation to farmers. Negligible biosecurity was implemented by farmers: almost no biosecurity procedures were performed for visitors entering a farm, and testing of animals was rarely undertaken before introducing them to a farm. However, the participants considered that improving biosecurity would be more acceptable and feasible than both the test-and-cull and the test-and-segregation approaches. Similarly, inadequate personal protection was used by veterinary personnel for handling parturition, retention of placenta and abortion cases; this was considered as another area of possible improvement. Farmers and veterinarians expressed serious concerns about stray cattle as many of them could potentially be infected with brucellosis, and thus could spread the infection between farms.

Due to the limited natural availability of these terpenes and the tight regulation of their biosynthesis, there is strong interest to introduce or enhance their production in crop plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. While engineering of monoterpenes has been quite successful, expression of sesquiterpene synthases in engineered plants frequently resulted in production of only minor amounts of sesquiterpenes. To identify bottlenecks for sesquiterpene engineering in plants, we have used two nearly identical terpene synthases, snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) nerolidol/linalool synthase-1 and -2 (AmNES/LIS-1/-2), that are localized in the cytosol and plastids, respectively. Since these two bifunctional terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), their expression in target tissues allows indirect determination of the availability of these substrates in both subcellular compartments. Both terpene synthases were expressed under control of the ripening specific PG promoter in tomato fruits, which are characterized by a highly active terpenoid metabolism providing precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis. As AmNES/LIS-2 fruits produced the monoterpene linalool, AmNES/LIS-1 fruits were found to exclusively produce the sesquiterpene nerolidol. While nerolidol emission in AmNES/LIS-1 fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower compared to linalool emission in AmNES/LIS-2 fruits, accumulation of nerolidol-glucosides in AmNES/LIS-1 fruits was 4- to 14-fold lower than that of linalool-glucosides in AmNES/LIS-2 fruits. These results suggest that only a relatively small pool of FPP is available for sesquiterpene formation in the cytosol. To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK). While HMGR and IPK expression increased metabolic flux toward nerolidol formation 5.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively, DXS expression only resulted in a 2.5-fold increase.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,NA,NA,1664-462X,,NA,MEDLINE:34220915,34220915,NA

Artificial microRNAs are one common approach, as they have the advantage of producing just a single functional small RNA, which can be designed for high target specificity and low off-target effects. Simultaneous silencing of multiple targets with artificial microRNAs can be achieved by producing polycistronic microRNA precursors. Alternatively, specialized trans-acting short interfering RNA (tasiRNA) precursors can be designed to produce several specific tasiRNAs at once. Here we tested several artificial microRNA- and tasiRNA-based methods for multiplexed gene silencing in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Nicotiana benthamiana. All analyses used transiently expressed transgenes delivered by infiltration of leaves with Agrobacterium tumefacians. Small RNA sequencing analyses revealed that many previously described approaches resulted in poor small RNA processing. The 5'-most microRNA precursor hairpins on polycistronic artificial microRNA precursors were generally processed more accurately than precursors at the 3'-end. Polycistronic artificial microRNAs where the hairpin precursors were separated by transfer RNAs had the best processing precision. Strikingly, artificial tasiRNA precursors failed to be processed in the expected phased manner in our system. These results highlight the need for further development of multiplexed artificial microRNA and tasiRNA strategies.

L. africanus' (Laf), only found in Africa; and (iii) the newly described 'Ca. L. americanus' (Lam), which appeared in 2005 in Brazil (5). Considered as a quarantine organism in America and Europe, Las is actively affecting North America and Asia, and research is leading toward psyllid management and resistance breeding. Despite the fact that Reunion Island has successfully controlled Las by introducing a psyllid parasitoid, Tamarixia radiata (1), this strategy was less effective or reproducible within other territories. D. citri was first detected in Guadeloupe in 1998, where the control of the the psyllid population has been effective with T. radiata (3); and was first detected in Martinique in 2012. Following the outbreak in the United States and the Caribbean, and also supported by reports of symptoms in citrus orchards, local National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPO) organized a detection survey across both islands to verify the occurrence of Huanglongbing. Since 2012, 450 sites were prospected each year in Martinique and Guadeloupe, where 20 leaves from 10 to 30 trees were analyzed. DNA extraction was performed (DNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen) on fresh or dried leaf midribs, along with negative control midribs (Citrus paradisi 'Star Rubis') and PCR amplification was done with the species-specific primers A2/J5 (4) and GB1/GB3 (5). Only Las-specific 703-bp amplicons were obtained (n = 43) and 20 were sequenced (Beckman Coulter Genomics, United Kingdom; sequences available through GenBank Accession Nos. KF699074 to KF699093) and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redondant database (NCBI-nr). BLAST analysis revealed 100% identity with the 50S ribosomal protein subunit L1 (rplA) and L10 (rplJ) of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' (all strains), and no significant homology to other organisms. Additionally, sequence assembly on a reference genome (NC_012985) showed 100% homology. Huanglongbing was detected in Guadeloupe on March 2012 at Le Moule (East coast) in a Tahiti lime orchard (C. latifolia) and crossed the island in 6 months. Las was detected in Martinique on May 2013 on Tahiti lime (C. latifolia) at Bellefontaine (Northwest) in a private garden and at Le Lorrain (Northeast) in an orchard. Other species from the Rutaceae family were affected by HLB (C. reticulat and C. sinensis) on both islands; however, few of the positive samples showed HLB symptoms (blotchy mottle patterns and green islands on leaves), but presented symptoms similar to nutrient deficiencies. Despite the former presence of T. radiata in Guadeloupe and its detection in Martinique a few weeks after the detection of D. citri, where it had a mean parasitism rate of 70%, an outbreak of HLB spread across both islands. These analyses confirm the presence of HLB in Martinique and Guadeloupe and to our knowledge represent the first report of Las in the French West Indies. Introduction events remain unclear, but this report raises the importance of plant certification, psyllid population control, and surveillance of territories close to the French West Indies, with regards to the risk that HLB presents to citrus production worldwide.

Faba bean seedlings were grown in pots containing agricultural soil, during 1 month under natural environmental conditions of Marrakech city in Morocco (March-April 2018) and exposed to cyanobacterial extracts containing up to 2.5 mg·L-1 of total MCs. Three independent exposure experiments were performed (a) agricultural soil was maintained intact exposure experiment 1; (b) agricultural soil was sterilized exposure experiment 2; (c) agricultural soil was sterilized and inoculated with the rhizobia strain Rhizobium leguminosarum RhOF34 exposure experiment 3. Overall, data showed evidence of an increased sensitivity of faba bean plants, grown in sterilized soil, to MCs in comparison to those grown in intact and inoculated soils. The study revealed the growth inhibition of plant shoots in both exposure experiments 2 and 3 when treated with 2.5 mg·L-1 of MCs. The results also showed that the estimated daily intake (EDI) of MCs, in sterilized soil, exceeded 2.18 and 1.16 times the reference concentrations (0.04 and 0.45 g of microcysin-leucine arginine (MC-LR).

Despite this vital role, there is limited information on the genetic diversity and BNF of bacteria nodulating common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). This study evaluated the genetic diversity and symbiotic nitrogen fixation of bacteria nodulating common bean in soils of Western Kenya. The genetic diversity was determined using 16S rRNA gene partial sequences while BNF was estimated in a greenhouse experiment. The sequences of the native isolates were closely affiliated with members from the genera Pantoea, Klebsiella, Rhizobium, Enterobacter and Bacillus. These results show that apart from rhizobia, there are non-rhizobial strains in the nodules of common bean. The symbiotic efficiency (SE) of native isolates varied and exhibited comparable or superior BNF compared to the local commercial inoculants (CIAT 899 and Strain 446).

The particular sensitivity of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters is exploited in nature, such that multiple sensor-regulator proteins, which coordinate the detection of analytes with a (in many cases) global transcriptional response, are Fe-S cluster proteins. The fragility and sensitivity of these Fe-S clusters make studying such proteins difficult, and gaining insight of what they sense, and how they sense it and transduce the signal to affect transcription, is a major challenge. While mass spectrometry is very widely used in biological research, it is normally employed under denaturing conditions where non-covalently attached cofactors are lost. However, mass spectrometry under conditions where the protein retains its native structure and, thus, cofactors, is now itself a flourishing field, and the application of such 'native' mass spectrometry to study metalloproteins is now relatively widespread. Here we describe recent advances in using native MS to study Fe-S cluster proteins. Through its ability to accurately measure mass changes that reflect chemistry occurring at the cluster, this approach has yielded a remarkable richness of information that is not accessible by other, more traditional techniques.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,NA,NA,,1477-9234,NA,MEDLINE:34037038,34037038,NA

Previous work indicated that Nobuto FP samples from caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus subspecies) had comparable sensitivity and specificity to serum samples (≥ 80% for both) in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (cELISAs) for Brucella spp., Neospora caninum, and West Nile virus. The same sensitivity and specificity criteria were met in indirect ELISAs for Brucella spp., bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), with adjusted FP thresholds used for PI-3 and BRSV. Comparable sensitivity and specificity values to serum were also observed for FP in virus neutralization (VN) assays for bovine viral diarrhea virus types I and II; however, reduced sensitivity is a potential limitation of FP samples in protocols that require undiluted serum (i.e., VN and N. caninum cELISA). We evaluated the performance of FP samples from reindeer and caribou in these nine assays after simulating potential challenges of high-latitude field collections: 1) different durations of storage and 2) different processing/storage regimes involving freezing or drying. Sample pairs (serum and FP) were collected from reindeer and caribou populations in 2007-10 and were tested in duplicate. Comparable performance to serum was defined as sensitivity and specificity ≥ 80%. In the storage experiments, FP performance was determined after 2 mo of storage dry at room temperature, and after two longer periods (variable depending on assay; up to 2 yr). After 1 yr, compared to frozen serum stored for the same period, sensitivity was ≥ 88% for all but two assays (68% BHV-1; 75% PI-3), and specificity remained >90%.
