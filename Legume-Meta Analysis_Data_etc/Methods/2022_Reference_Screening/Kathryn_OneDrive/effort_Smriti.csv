However, much less is known about the identities or evolutionary dynamics of the symbiotic microbes that accompany invasive species. Most leguminous plants rely upon symbiotic rhizobium bacteria to fix nitrogen and are incapable of colonizing areas devoid of compatible rhizobia. We compare the genomes of symbiotic rhizobia in a portion of the legume's invaded range with those of the rhizobium symbionts from across the legume's native range. We show that in an area of California the legume Medicago polymorpha has invaded, its Ensifer medicae symbionts: (i) exhibit genome-wide patterns of relatedness that together with historical evidence support host-symbiont co-invasion from Europe into California, (ii) exhibit population genomic patterns consistent with the introduction of the majority of deep diversity from the native range, rather than a genetic bottleneck during colonization of California and (iii) harbor a large set of accessory genes uniquely enriched in binding functions, which could play a role in habitat invasion.

Most knowledge on the genetic basis of symbiosis is based on model strains belonging to alpha-rhizobia. Mimosa pudica is a legume that offers an excellent opportunity to study the adaptation toward symbiotic nitrogen fixation in beta-rhizobia compared to alpha-rhizobia. In a previous study (Melkonian et al., Environ Microbiol 16:2099-111, 2014) we described the symbiotic competitiveness of M. pudica symbionts belonging to Burkholderia, Cupriavidus and Rhizobium species.RESULTS: In this article we present a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (by RNAseq) of B. phymatum STM815 (BP), C. taiwanensis LMG19424 (CT) and R. mesoamericanum STM3625 (RM) in conditions mimicking the early steps of symbiosis (i.e. perception of root exudates). BP exhibited the strongest transcriptome shift both quantitatively and qualitatively, which mirrors its high competitiveness in the early steps of symbiosis and its ancient evolutionary history as a symbiont, while CT had a minimal response which correlates with its status as a younger symbiont (probably via acquisition of symbiotic genes from a Burkholderia ancestor) and RM had a typical response of Alphaproteobacterial rhizospheric bacteria. Interestingly, the upregulation of nodulation genes was the only common response among the three strains; the exception was an up-regulated gene encoding a putative fatty acid hydroxylase, which appears to be a novel symbiotic gene specific to Mimosa symbionts.CONCLUSION: The transcriptional response to root exudates was correlated to each strain nodulation competitiveness, with Burkholderia phymatum appearing as the best specialised symbiont of Mimosa pudica.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,0,0,0,11,0,14,NA,NA,,1471-2164,NA,MEDLINE:29378510,29378510,NA

Individual symbiosis genes (e.g., nodC) of these rhizobia can be different within each genus and among distinct genera. Little information is available about the symbiotic structure of indigenous Rhizobium strains nodulating introduced bean plants or the emergence of a symbiotic ability to associate with bean plants in Bradyrhizobium and Ensifer strains. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 29 representative bean microsymbionts (21 Rhizobium, four Ensifer, and four Bradyrhizobium) and compared them with closely related reference strains to estimate the origins of symbiosis genes among these Chinese bean microsymbionts.RESULTS: Comparative genomics demonstrated horizontal gene transfer exclusively at the plasmid level, leading to expanded diversity of bean-nodulating Rhizobium strains. Analysis of vertically transferred genes uncovered 191 (out of the 2654) single-copy core genes with phylogenies strictly consistent with the taxonomic status of bacterial species, but none were found on symbiosis plasmids. A common symbiotic region was wholly conserved within the Rhizobium genus yet different from those of the other two genera. A single strain of Ensifer and two Bradyrhizobium strains shared similar gene content with soybean microsymbionts in both chromosomes and symbiotic regions.CONCLUSIONS: The 19 native bean Rhizobium microsymbionts were assigned to four defined species and six putative novel species. The symbiosis genes of R. phaseoli, R. sophoriradicis, and R. esperanzae strains that originated from Mexican bean-nodulating strains were possibly introduced alongside bean seeds. R. anhuiense strains displayed distinct host ranges, indicating transition into bean microsymbionts. Among the six putative novel species exclusive to China, horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes suggested symbiosis with other indigenous legumes and loss of originally symbiotic regions or non-symbionts before the introduction of common bean into China.

Numerous studies implicate factors ranging from environmental plasticity, competition for nutrient and space, and allelopathy in the success of invasive species in general. The Brazilian Pepper tree (BP) was introduced to the United States in the 1800s and has since become a category one invasive plant in Florida. It has aggressively spread to about 3000 km(2) of terrestrial surface, fueled in part by the prevalence of the hybrid genotypes and environmental perturbations. It displays some of the well-established invasive mechanisms but there is a serious dearth of knowledge on the plant-microbe-soil interactions and whether the rhizobiome plays any roles in the displacement of native flora and the range expansion of BP. Several control measures, including chemical, mechanical, and biological antagonism have been used with limited success while restoration of natives in soils from which BP was removed has proved problematic partly due to a poorly understood phenomenon described as the BP legacy effect. Emerging evidence suggests that allelopathy, selective recruitment of beneficial soil microbes, disruption of microbial community structure and alteration of nutrient cycling, exhibited by many other invasive plant species may also be involved in the case of BP. This brief review discusses the well-established BP invasion mechanisms and highlights the current understanding of the molecular, below-ground processes. It also points out the gaps in studies on the potential role of microbial interactions in the success of BP invasion. These hitherto poorly studied mechanisms could further explain the aggressive spread of BP and could potentially contribute significantly to effective control measures and enable appropriate strategies for restoring native plants. The review advocates for the use of cutting-edge techniques in advancing the plant microbiome science. Ultimately, comparing metagenomic analyses of the rhizobiome of invasive plants grown in native and non-native soils could lead to a better understanding of the microbial determinants of biotic resistance, potentially empowering environmental managers with some predictive power of future trends of plant invasion.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,0,0,0,14,2,20,NA,NA,1664-462X,,NA,MEDLINE:27252726,27252726,NA

NccX crystal structure did not match the model based on the extensively characterized periplasmic domain of its closest homologue CnrX. Instead, the periplasmic domains of NccX appeared collapsed against the hydrophobic transmembrane segments, leading to an aberrant topology incompatible with membrane insertion. This was explained by a detergent-induced redistribution of the hydrophobic interactions among the transmembrane helices and a pair of hydrophobic patches keeping the periplasmic domains together in the native dimer. Molecular dynamics simulations performed with the full-length protein or with the transmembrane segments were used along with in vivo homodimerization assays (TOXCAT) to evaluate the determinants of the interactions between NccX protomers. Taken as a whole, computational and experimental results are in agreement with the structural model of CnrX where a cradle-shaped periplasmic metal sensor domain is anchored into the inner membrane by two N-terminal helices.

To overcome this limitation, a variation of the mini-CTX-lux plasmid has been designed which allows reduction of promoter activity via the addition of an adjacent fluoride riboswitch. The riboswitch adds a layer of regulation between the promoter and the reporter gene, allowing cloning of stronger promoters by weakening expression, while giving the potential to induce with fluoride to provide a good signal for weaker promoters, thus circumventing limitations associated with reporter toxicity.

This study systematically characterized the broad host range plasmids pBHR1, pBBR1MCS-2 and pKT230 used frequently for C. necator engineering. Kanamycin resistance cassette (KanR) and a truncated sequence of the replication origin (Rep) are contributing factors to C. necator low electroporation transformation efficiency. Consequently, a series of modular minimal plasmids, named pCAT, were constructed. pCAT vectors transform C. necator H16 with a > 3000-fold higher efficiency (up to 107 CFU/mug DNA) compared to control plasmids. Further, pCAT vectors are highly stable, expressing reporter proteins over several days of serial cultivation in the absence of selection pressure. Finally, they can be assembled rapidly from PCR or synthesized DNA fragments, and restriction-ligation reactions can be efficiently electroporated directly into C. necator, circumventing the requirement to use Escherichia coli for plasmid maintenance or propagation.

Infection occurs in humans and animals, typically through direct exposure to soil or water containing the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Case clusters of melioidosis have been described in humans following severe weather events and in exotic animals imported into melioidosis endemic zones. Direct transmission of B. pseudomallei between animals and/or humans has been documented but is considered extremely rare. Between March 2015 and October 2016 eight fatal cases of melioidosis were reported in slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) on display at a Wildlife Park in Northern Australia. To further investigate the melioidosis case cluster we sampled the meerkat enclosure and adjacent park areas and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all culture-positive B. pseudomallei environmental and clinical isolates.RESULTS: WGS confirmed that the fatalities were caused by two different B. pseudomallei sequence types (STs) but that seven of the meerkat isolates were highly similar on the whole-genome level. Used concurrently with detailed pathology data, our results demonstrate that the seven cases originated from a single original source, but routes of infection varied amongst meerkats belonging to the clonal outbreak cluster. Moreover, in some instances direct transmission may have transpired through wounds inflicted while fighting.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study supports the use of high-resolution WGS to enhance epidemiological investigations into transmission modalities and pathogenesis of melioidosis, especially in the instance of a possible clonal outbreak scenario in exotic zoological collections.

White-rot fungi (WRF) have broad-spectrum potential for such refractory organics bioremediation; however, their applications are largely restrained by the poor viability owning to microbial invasion under non-sterile conditions. In this study, short-term pre-exposure to silver ion (Ag+) was demonstrated to be a practical, economic, and green method to enhance the perdurability of azo dyes decoloration by WRF Phanerochaete chrysosporium under non-sterile conditions. In control (without Ag+ pre-exposure), decoloration deactivated since cycle 7 (<10%), whereas in Ag+ pre-exposure groups, the decoloration ratios remained 91.5%-94.7% after 7cycles. Variations in decoloration-related extracellular lignin enzyme activities were consistent with the decoloration effectiveness. The enhanced decoloration capability in Ag+ pre-exposure groups under non-sterile conditions could be ascribed to the selectively antimicrobial action by Ag+. The released Ag+ from the self-assembled silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could selectively stimulate the proliferation and viability of P. chrysosporium, and simultaneously inhibit the growths of invasive microorganisms. The pyrosequencing results indicated that genus Sphingomonas (24.1%-31.3%) was the main invasive bacteria in Ag+ pre-exposure groups after long-term operation owing to the AgNPs passivation. As control, the invasive fungi (Asterotremella humicola) and bacteria (Burkholderia spp.) occurred in control after short-term operation, and genus Burkholderia (74.9%) dominated after long-term operation, leading to decoloration deactivation.

It also expected to achieve cell rapid growth and large accumulation of PHB simultaneously under the oxygen-limiting condition in C. necator H16. In this study, a metabolically engineered strain capable of both rapid growth and large accumulation of PHB under oxygen-limiting conditions was constructed based on the transcriptomic analysis. In the comparative transcriptomic analysis, the genes related to energy-generating of C. necator H16 at autotrophic culture were downregulated under oxygen-limiting conditions (3%, v/v). Besides, the genes related to the key intermediates (pyruvate and acetyl-CoA) metabolism in PHB biosynthetic pathway were analyzed. Most of which were downregulated, except the genes ldh, iclA, and ackA2 respectively encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, and acetate kinase were upregulated under oxygen-limiting conditions (3%, v/v). The Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) has the ability to promote aerobic metabolism and energy generation. To promote the bacterium growth and improve the energy generation in C. necator H16 under oxygen-limiting conditions, the VHb gene was introduced into C. necator H16 with the optimized promoter PphaC1-j5. Moreover, VHb was localized to the periplasmic space of the bacterium by the traction of membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) signal peptide. By optimizing the knockout of different genes, it was found that knockout of ldh can improve PHB production and reduce the by-products. Finally, a recombinant strain Reh01 (p2M-pj-v) was constructed by heterologous expression of vgb and ldh knockout in C. necator H16. Compared with the control (Reh (p2)) under oxygen-limiting conditions (3%, v/v), the dry cell weight (DCW), PHB content, and PHB production of Reh01 (p2M-pj-v) increased by 31.0%, 30.9%, and 71.5%, respectively.

Transcriptomic- and proteomic-based methodologies have been used to investigate mechanisms of virulence employed by B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis, a convenient surrogate; however, analysis of the pathogen and host metabolomes during infection is lacking. Changes in the metabolites produced can be a result of altered gene expression and/or post-transcriptional processes. Thus, metabolomics complements transcriptomics and proteomics by providing a chemical readout of a biological phenotype, which serves as a snapshot of an organism's physiological state. However, the poor signal from bacterial metabolites in the context of infection poses a challenge in their detection and robust annotation. In this study, we coupled mammalian cell culture-based metabolomics with feature-based molecular networking of mono- and co-cultures to annotate the pathogen's secondary metabolome during infection of mammalian cells. These methods enabled us to identify several key secondary metabolites produced by B. thailandensis during infection of airway epithelial and macrophage cell lines. Additionally, the use of in silico approaches provided insights into shifts in host biochemical pathways relevant to defense against infection. Using chemical class enrichment analysis, for example, we identified changes in a number of host-derived compounds including immune lipids such as prostaglandins, which were detected exclusively upon pathogen challenge.

Candidate macrophage-induced B. pseudomallei genes were identified from the location of the insertions containing an active promoter activity. A proportion of the 138 genes identified in this way have been previously reported to be involved in metabolism and transport, virulence, or adaptation. Novel macrophage-induced B. pseudomallei genes were also identified. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis of 13 selected genes confirmed gene induction during macrophage infection. Deletion mutants of two macrophage-induced genes from this study were attenuated in Galleria mellonella larvae, suggesting roles in virulence. B. pseudomallei genes activated during macrophage infection may contribute to intracellular life and pathogenesis and merit further investigation toward control strategies for melioidosis.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:32153515,32153515,NA

They can code for many functions and may augment a bacterium's adaptation to its host or environment. GIs have been identified in strain J2315 of Burkholderia cenocepacia, whereas in strain AU 1054 there has been no published works on such regions according to our text mining and keyword search in Medline.RESULTS: In this study, we identified 21 GIs in AU 1054 by combining two computational tools. Feature analyses suggested that the predictions are highly reliable and hence illustrated the advantage of joint predictions by two independent methods. Based on putative virulence factors, four GIs were further identified as pathogenicity islands (PAIs). Through experiments of gene deletion mutants in live bacteria, two putative PAIs were confirmed, and the virulence factors involved were identified as lipA and copR. The importance of the genes lipA (from PAI 1) and copR (from PAI 2) for bacterial invasion and replication indicates that they are required for the invasive properties of B. cenocepacia and may function as virulence determinants for bacterial pathogenesis and host infection.CONCLUSIONS: This approach of in silico prediction of GIs and subsequent identification of potential virulence factors in the putative island regions with final validation using wet experiments could be used as an effective strategy to rapidly discover novel virulence factors in other bacterial species and strains.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,NA,NA,,1471-2180,NA,MEDLINE:28347342,28347342,NA

This study explores the mechanistic basis of this regulation. We provide evidence that FeuN directly interacts with the sensor kinase FeuQ. Isolation and characterization of an extensive set of FeuN-insensitive and FeuN-mimicking variants of FeuQ reveal specific FeuQ residues (periplasmic and intracellular) that control the transmission of FeuN-specific signalling information. Similar analysis of the FeuN protein highlights short patches of compatibly charged residues on each protein that probably engage one another, giving rise to the downstream effects on target gene expression. The accumulated evidence suggests that the periplasmic interaction between FeuN and FeuQ introduces an intracellular conformational change in FeuQ, resulting in an increase in its ability to remove phosphate from its cognate response regulator FeuP.

Here, we report that, unexpectedly, the S. fredii NGR234 ETR region did not complement deletion of the S. meliloti ETR region in symbiosis with Medicago sativa. This phenotype was due to the bacA gene of NGR234 not being functionally interchangeable with the S. meliloti bacA gene during M. sativa symbiosis. Further analysis revealed that, whereas bacA genes from S. fredii or Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 failed to complement the Fix- phenotype of a S. meliloti bacA mutant with M. sativa, they allowed for further developmental progression prior to a loss of viability. In contrast, with Melilotus alba, bacA from S. fredii and R. leguminosarum supported N2 fixation by a S. meliloti bacA mutant. Additionally, the S. meliloti bacA gene can support N2 fixation of a R. leguminosarum bacA mutant during symbiosis with Pisum sativum.

Despite these applications, some forms of polystyrene PS remain financially and environmentally expensive to send to landfills. The prodegraded PS0 waste plastics used were broken down at varied high temperatures while exposed to ozone. These variables produced PS flakes (PS1⁻3) and a powder (PS4) with individual acid numbers. Consequently, after fermentation, different PHAs and amounts of biomass were produced. The bacterial strain, Cupriavidus necator H16, was selected for this study due to its well-documented genetic profile, stability, robustness, and ability to produce PHAs at relatively low temperatures. The accumulation of PHAs varied from 39% for prodegraded PS0 in nitrogen rich media to 48% (w/w) of dry biomass with the treated PS.

Since many factors strongly influence the success of bioaugmentation, selected abiotic and biotic factors such as pH, temperature, type of soil, pesticide concentration, content of water and organic matter, additional carbon and nitrogen sources, inoculum size, interactions between the introduced strains and autochthonous microorganisms as well as the survival of inoculants were presented.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,202,14,2,0,153,1,216,NA,NA,,1879-1298,NA,MEDLINE:28061345,28061345,NA

Conjugation of polysaccharides to a carrier protein triggers a T-cell-dependent immune response to the glycan moiety. Licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are produced by chemical conjugation of capsular polysaccharides to prevent meningitis caused by meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b. However, other classes of carbohydrates (O-antigens, exopolysaccharides, wall/teichoic acids) represent attractive targets for developing vaccines. Recent analysis from WHO/CHO underpins alarming concern toward antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as the so called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) and additional pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and Group A Streptococcus. Fungal infections are also becoming increasingly invasive for immunocompromised patients or hospitalized individuals. Other emergencies could derive from bacteria which spread during environmental calamities (Vibrio cholerae) or with potential as bioterrorism weapons (Burkholderia pseudomallei and mallei, Francisella tularensis).

We used shotgun DNA sequencing to better understand the link between bacterial community composition and functional capacity in the rhizospheric microbiomes associated with invasive A. dealbata populations in South Africa. Our analysis showed that several genes associated with plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits were significantly overrepresented in the rhizospheric metagenomes compared to neighbouring bulk soils collected away from A. dealbata stands. The majority of these genes are involved in the metabolism of nitrogen, carbohydrates and vitamins, and in various membrane transport systems. Overrepresented genes were linked to a limited number of bacterial taxa, mostly Bradyrhizobium species, the preferred N-fixing rhizobial symbiont of Australian acacias.

Here, we describe the 'cheating effect', a form of intra-specific competition that can counterbalance between-species competition, thereby fostering biodiversity in unstructured habitats. Using experimental communities consisting of the strong competitor Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its weaker counterpart Burkholderia cenocepacia (BC), we show that co-existence is impossible when the two species compete for a single limiting resource, iron. However, when introducing a PA cheating mutant, which specifically exploits the iron-scavenging siderophores produced by the PA wild type, we found that biodiversity was preserved under well-mixed conditions where PA cheats could outcompete the PA wild type.

Initial screening of a B. pseudomallei signature-tagged mutagenesis library identified an attenuated mutant with a transposon insertion in a gene encoding the sensor component of an uncharacterised two-component signal transduction system (TCSTS), which we designated BprRS.RESULTS: Single gene inactivation of either the response regulator gene (bprR) or the sensor histidine kinase gene (bprS) resulted in mutants with reduced swarming motility and reduced virulence in mice. However, a bprRS double mutant was not attenuated for virulence and displayed wild-type levels of motility. The transcriptomes of the bprS, bprR and bprRS mutants were compared with the transcriptome of the parent strain K96243. Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS (bprRS double mutant) resulted in altered expression of only nine genes, including both bprR and bprS, five phage-related genes and bpss0686, encoding a putative 5, 10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase involved in one carbon metabolism. In contrast, the transcriptomes of each of the bprR and bprS single gene mutants revealed more than 70 differentially expressed genes common to both mutants, including regulatory genes and those required for flagella assembly and for the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic polyketide, malleilactone.CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS did not alter virulence or motility and very few genes were differentially expressed indicating that the definitive BprRS regulon is relatively small.

Two types of proteins, PHA synthase (PhaC) and phasins (PhaPs), are attached to the PHA surface by covalent and hydrophobic interactions. Utilizing these anchored proteins, functionalized PHA nano-granules displaying proteins of interest can be easily prepared by fermentation.RESULTS: In this study, a one-step fabrication method was developed for stable and efficient immobilization of an organophosphorus degrading enzyme on PHA nano-granules. The nano-biocatalysts were produced in recombinant Escherichia coli cells into which the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis pathway from Cupriavidus necator had been introduced. Two different strategies, covalent attachment and hydrophobic binding, were investigated by fusing bacterial organophosphorus anhydride hydrolase (OPAA4301) with PhaC and PhaP, respectively. Using both methods, the tetrameric enzyme successfully self-assembled and was displayed on the PHA surface. The display density of the target fused enzyme was enhanced to 6.8% of total protein on decorated PHA by combination of covalent and non-covalent binding modes. Immobilization of the enzyme on PHA granules resulted in higher catalytic efficiency, increased stability and excellent reusability. The kcat values of the immobilized enzymes increased by threefold compared to that of the free enzyme. The pH stability under acidic conditions was significantly enhanced, and the immobilized enzyme was stable at pH 3.0-11.0. Furthermore, more than 80% of the initial enzyme activity retained after recycling ten times.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a promising approach for cost-efficient in vivo immobilization of a tetrameric organophosphorus degrading enzyme. The immobilization process expands the utility of the enzyme, and may inspire further commercial developments of PHA nano-biocatalysts.

The Bcc supplement (S2-BCC-S) was purposely developed and used with the Pseudomonas vial (PD-109) for the detection of Bcc through the Soleris Next Generation automated instrument system.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the Soleris Bcc testing method for cosmetic products.METHOD: Inclusivity and exclusivity were assessed with the Soleris Bcc method and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) method in three enrichment broths. Matrix testing was conducted using 28 cosmetic products to compare the equivalency of the Soleris Bcc method to that of the USP reference method. Repeatability of the Soleris Bcc assay, method robustness, product stability, and lot-to-lot consistency of the Soleris reagents were also assessed.RESULTS: Both the Soleris Bcc and the USP methods supported the growth of all 26 inclusivity strains, except the USP method missed one inclusivity strain in one broth. For exclusivity, 0-6% was presumptive positive with the Soleris Bcc method, and 42-48% was presumptive positive with the reference method.

In this study, 131 strains of potential nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated and purified from the roots of the invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, in Southwest China. Phylogenetically, these reNFB were categorized into three phyla at 97% sequence identity that included Proteobacteria (92.4%), Actinobacteria (4.6%), and Firmicutes (3.1%).

The community composition and diversity of A. adenophora reNFB were markedly different across study regions. The capacity of these reNFB to accumulate indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphate, and produce siderophores was determined. All 131 isolates of reNFB accumulated IAA, 67 isolates solubilized phosphate, and 108 isolates produced siderophores. Among the three dominant genera of reNFB, Pseudomonas had the highest phosphorus solubilization and siderophore production, while the accumulation of IAA in the genus Duganella was the lowest. Interestingly, the calculated reNFB Shannon diversity index of each A. adenophora individual was negatively correlated with the capacity of reNFB to produce growth-promoting products. Six randomly selected isolates from three dominant genera were further used to conduct inoculation experiments, and all isolates showed significant positive growth-promoting effects on A. adenophora seedlings. The contribution of reNFB to the root biomass was higher than that to the shoot biomass.

The reaction proceeds in the following pathway: laccase catalyzes the oxidation of catechol to o-quinone followed by lipase comediated Michael addition of a diamine. While laccase could catalyze the entire process, addition of lipase is able to increase copolymer yield up to 30.7%.

Swab samples were randomly collected for bacterial culture before patient use from 10 each of the two machine types in August 2001; these included 20 samples from each of the following: Drain tubes, operating water chambers, oscillators, and nebulizing chambers. In addition, 10 samples each of nebulizer solutions before and after use were cultured.

Numbers of Bcc isolates were compared before and after introduction of new methods for nebulizer maintenance in October 2001. In addition, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay was applied to find the genetic divergence of the Bcc isolates obtained from clinical samples and nebulizers.RESULTS: From January 1999 to December 2013, a total of 487 Bcc isolates were obtained from clinical specimens from 181 patients.

RAPD assays revealed similar DNA profiles in isolates obtained from patients and nebulizers. Investigation revealed damaged diaphragms in many nebulizers. The new maintenance methods for nebulizers, including restriction of the usage period, thorough disinfection, and routine check for diaphragm breakage, remarkably reduced Bcc isolation (165 isolates from patients in 12 years and 0 isolate from nebulizers in periodical sampling).

By knocking out either CBB operon genes on the operon or mega-plasmid of R. eutropha, we found that both CBB operons were active and contributed almost equally to the carbon fixation process. With similar knock-out experiments, we found both soluble and membrane-bound hydrogenases (SH and MBH), belonging to the energy providing hydrogenase module, were functional during autotrophic growth of R. eutropha. SH played a more significant role. By introducing a heterologous cyanobacterial RuBisCO with the endogenous GroES/EL chaperone system(A quality control systems for proteins consisting of molecular chaperones and proteases, which prevent protein aggregation by either refolding or degrading misfolded proteins) and RbcX(A chaperone in the folding of Rubisco), the culture OD600 of engineered strain increased 89.2% after 72h of autotrophic growth, although the difference was decreased at 96h, indicating cyanobacterial RuBisCO with a higher activity was functional in R. eutropha and lead to improved growth in comparison to the host specific enzyme.

Using the lasso method for variable selection, we divided the dataset into training and validation samples (2:1), and developed two multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to calculate probabilities of survival from baseline (T0 model), and from 1year after (T12 model). We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.RESULTS: 4752 people were included. For the T0 model, FEV1; insurance; non-invasive ventilation; supplemental oxygen; Burkholderia colonisation; cirrhosis; depression; dialysis; current smoking; unclassifiable mutation class and cumulative CF exacerbations predicted increased mortality. Baseline transplant evaluation status of 'accepted, on waiting list' predicted decreased mortality. For the T12 model, interim decrease in FEV1 >10%, and pulmonary exacerbations additionally increased predicted mortality. Lung transplantation was associated with lower mortality. Of the 4752, 93.5%, 86.4%, 79.7% and 73.9% survived to 1, 2, 3 and 4years, respectively, without considering any confounding variables. The models had moderate predictive ability indicated by the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.787, 95%CI 0.769 to 0.794 for T0 model; and 0.779, 95%CI 0.767 to 0.797 for T12 model).CONCLUSION: We have developed models predicting survival in people with incident advanced stage CF, which can be reapplied over time to support shared decision-making about end-of-life treatment choices and lung transplantation.

Their efficacy was compared to endotracheal aspiration (ETA) and protected specimen brushing (PSB), the standard methods approved for HAP diagnosis.RESULTS: Initially, 56 patients were enrolled. Significant amounts of bacterial pathogens were detected in 48 patients (79 isolates) in Round A and in 39 patients (45 isolates) in Round B (after 72 hours). The sensitivity rates were: ETA 98%, PSB 31%, OS 64% and GA 67% in Round A and ETA 87%, PSB 32%, OS 74% and GA 42% in Round B. Strains of 12 bacterial species were identified in the samples.

Interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) span a continuum of specialization, and promiscuous legumes are thought to have higher chances of forming effective symbioses in novel ranges. Using Australian Acacia species in South Africa, it was hypothesized that widespread and highly invasive species will be more generalist in their rhizobial symbiotic requirements and more effective in fixing atmospheric nitrogen compared with localized and less invasive species.Methods: To test these hypotheses, eight localized and 11 widespread acacias were examined using next-generation sequencing data for the nodulation gene, nodC , to compare the identity, species richness, diversity and compositional similarity of rhizobia associated with these acacias. Stable isotope analysis was also used to determine levels of nitrogen obtained from the atmosphere via symbiotic nitrogen fixation.Key Results: No differences were found in richness, diversity and community composition between localized and widespread acacias. Similarly, widespread and localized acacias did not differ in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. However, for some species by site comparisons, significant differences in delta15N isotopic signatures were found, indicating differential symbiotic effectiveness between these species at specific localities.Conclusions: Overall, the results support recent findings that root nodule rhizobial diversity and community composition do not differ between acacias that vary in their invasiveness. Differential invasiveness of acacias in South Africa is probably linked to attributes such as differences in propagule pressure, reasons for (e.g. forestry vs. ornamental) and extent of, plantings in the country.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17,0,0,0,13,0,18,NA,NA,,1095-8290,NA,MEDLINE:28369229,28369229,NA

Six ticks, including Amblyomma triguttatum, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, Haemaphysalis novaeguineae, Ixodes cornuatus, Ixodes holocyclus, and Ixodes tasmani may transmit Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia australis, Rickettsia honei, or Rickettsia honei subsp. marmionii.

Moreover, the geographical conditions of Australia are favorable for many exotic ticks, which may become endemic to Australia given an opportunity.

We sought to determine whether the mosquito microbiota associated with immature stages of two congeners (Culex coronator and Culex nigripalpus) differ temporally and between the two species. Using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities found in the immature stages of the two Culex mosquito species sampled over three seasons to compare the diversity of bacteria between the two species. Beta diversity analyses of the larval microbiota sequences revealed that the two Culex species differed significantly, both temporally within each species and between the two species. Bacteria in Cx. coronator larvae were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, mainly associated with Roseoccocus and unidentified species of Rhizobiales, and two unidentified species of Cyanobacteria. In contrast, Cx. nigripalpus was dominated by Thorsellia anophelis (Gammaproteobacteria), Clostridium, an unidentified species of Ruminococcacae (Clostridiales), and additional unidentified species associated with Erysipelotrichaceae (Erysipelotrichales), Bacteroidales, and Mollicutes.

Recent examples include tree diseases such as sudden oak death in the Western United States and ash dieback in Europe. To control an invading pathogen it is crucial that newly infected sites are quickly detected so that measures can be implemented to control the epidemic. However, since sampling resources are often limited, not all locations can be inspected and locations must be prioritized for surveying. Existing approaches to achieve this are often species specific and rely on detailed data collection and parameterization, which is difficult, especially when new arrivals are unanticipated. Consequently regulatory sampling responses are often ad hoc and developed without due consideration of epidemiology, leading to the suboptimal deployment of expensive sampling resources. We introduce a flexible risk-based sampling method that is pathogen generic and enables available information to be utilized to develop epidemiologically informed sampling programs for virtually any biologically relevant plant pathogen. By targeting risk we aim to inform sampling schemes that identify high-impact locations that can be subsequently treated in order to reduce inoculum in the landscape. This damage limitation is often the initial management objective following the first discovery of a new invader. Risk at each location is determined by the product of the basic reproductive number (R0), as a measure of local epidemic size, and the probability of infection. We illustrate how the risk estimates can be used to prioritize a survey by weighting a random sample so that the highest-risk locations have the highest probability of selection. We demonstrate and test the method using a high-quality spatially and temporally resolved data set on Huanglongbing disease (HLB) in Florida, USA.

PMI showed infiltrative lung shadow, ascites, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a wide infarction in the right parietal lobe, and multiple new cerebral infarctions. Autopsy examination showed purulent ascites, diffuse peritonitis, invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis that likely caused the cerebral infarctions. A 65-year-old man with an old pontine infarction presented with a fever and neutropenia. Despite appropriate treatment, his fever persisted. CT showed bilateral upper lobe pneumonia, pain appeared in both femoral regions, and intramuscular abscesses of both shoulders developed. His pneumonia worsened, his level of consciousness decreased, right hemiplegia developed, and he died. PMI showed a newly diagnosed cerebral infarction in the left parietal lobe. The autopsy revealed bilateral bronchopneumonia, right-sided pleuritis with effusion, an intramuscular abscess in the right thigh, and fresh multiple organ infarctions. Systemic fibrin thrombosis and DIC were also found. Postmortem cultures showed E. coli and Burkholderia cepacia.CONCLUSION: Cerebral infarction that is newly recognized on PMI might suggest the presence of severe systemic infection.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,2,0,0,2,0,9,NA,NA,,1471-2342,NA,MEDLINE:28068928,28068928,NA

Here, we review recent research into the molecular mechanisms that control ectomycorrhizal associations in Populus sp. with particular emphasis on the discovery that ectomycorrhizal fungi produce lipochitooligosaccharides capable of activating the common symbiosis pathway. We also present new evidence that lipo-chitooligosaccharides produced by both ectomycorrhizal fungi and various species of rhizobia that do not associate with Populus sp. can induce nuclear calcium spiking in the roots of Populus sp. Thus, we argue Populus sp. already possesses the molecular machinery necessary for perceiving rhizobia, and the next step in engineering symbiosis with rhizobia should be focused on inducing bacterial accommodation and nodule organogenesis. The gene Nodule INception is central to these processes, and several putative orthologs are present in Populus sp.

It is necessary to know the mechanism to understand the involvement of regulatory proteins which could be the probable targets for genetic modification to enhance or regulate yield of BC and to alter BC properties as well.

Diagnosis currently relies on culture; however, this delays appropriate antibiotics and contributes to mortality as results can take up to one week or more. Several non-culture based diagnostic tests are available; however, their role remains a point of contention. This review was performed to characterise the accuracy of various diagnostic tests.METHODS: Medline/Pubmed, CINAHL, Informit, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception to April 2020. Clinical trials investigating diagnostic tests capable of providing results in ≤48 hours using samples from suspected human cases; with bacterial culture as the reference test, and reporting sensitivity and specificity were eligible for inclusion. Data was pooled using bivariate analysis for diagnostic tests reported in ≥4 studies.RESULTS: 22 publications comprising 10963 individual tests were included. Meta-analysis was able to be performed for immunofluorescence assay (sensitivity 63.8% [95% CI, 45.6-78.7%]; specificity 99.4% [95% CI, 97.2-99.9%]), polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 77.1 [95% CI, 20.8%-97.8%]; specificity 99.8 [95% CI, 91.6%-100.0%]) and lateral flow immunoassay (sensitivity 58.2% [95% CI, 34.1%-78.9%]; specificity 95.0% [95% CI, 93.3%-96.3%]). Measures of sensitivity were overall similar although specificity of immunofluorescence assay was statistically superior to lateral flow immunoassay. There was a trend for reduced sensitivity of direct detection methods applied to blood samples compared to other sample types, although statistically insignificant. Serological methods were unable to be meta-analysed due to an insufficient number of studies, but their sensitivities were generally higher than direct detection methods (median 84% [IQR 71.5-88%] vs 51% [IQR 39-79%]), however they lacked specificity compared to direct detection (median 82% [IQR 70-86%] vs 98% [IQR 95-100%]).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no method showed sensitivity and specificity which would allow it to substitute culture. Serological tests may play a role in ruling out infection in endemic regions given their higher sensitivity, with direct detection methods being used for diagnostic confirmation.

This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria.

It is thought that in many cases of invasive neonatal GBS disease, the bacteria ascend the vagina into the uterus and infect the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. Important constituents of this environment include the polyols or sugar alcohols of which erythritol, sorbitol and mannitol are examples. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of polyols on GBS grown in media containing these sugar alcohols.RESULTS: GBS incubated in varying concentrations of polyols (erythritol, sorbitol or mannitol) did not display any significant enhancement or inhibition of bacterial growth. However, growth of GBS in the presence of erythritol significantly increased the surface expression of GBS-PGK (a plasminogen binding protein) 1.25 to 1.5-fold depending on the erythritol concentration and significantly enhanced the survival in human blood 3X to 18X depending on the concentration of polyol used. Interestingly, GBS grown in 1% erythritol significantly increased invasion by the bacteria of HeLa cells (epithelial cell line) (150% vs 100%) however, at higher concentrations (2% or 4% of polyol) the number of CFUs was significantly reduced (55-75% vs 100%) suggesting higher concentrations of polyols may inhibit invasion. Erythritol also increased GBS hemolytic activity as well as enhancing biofilm formation 1.4X to 3.3X depending on the concentration of polyol used.CONCLUSIONS: GBS grown in the presence of polyols alters the bacteria's phenotype resulting in changes associated with GBS virulence. This effect was greatest for the polyol erythritol.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,NA,NA,,1471-2180,NA,MEDLINE:33985431,33985431,NA

In recent years, genome editing techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been highlighted as a new approach to plant breeding. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been widely utilized to generate transgenic plants by introducing plasmid DNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 into plant cells. However, this method has general limitations, such as the limited host range of Agrobacterium and difficulties in tissue culture, including callus induction and regeneration. To avoid these issues, we developed a method to genetically modify germ cells without the need for Agrobacterium-mediated transfection and tissue culture using tobacco as a model. In this study, plasmid DNA containing sequences of Cas9, guide RNA, and fluorescent reporter was introduced into pollen using a biolistic delivery system. Based on the transient expression of fluorescent reporters, the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter was found to be the most suitable promoter for driving the expression of the delivered gene in pollen tubes. We also evaluated the delivery efficiency in male germ cells in the pollen by expression of the introduced fluorescent marker. Mutations were detected in the target gene in the genomic DNA extracted from CRISPR/Cas9-introduced pollen tubes, but were not detected in the negative control. Bombarded pollen germinated pollen tubes and delivered their contents into the ovules in vivo.

The CPR plants have no differences in morphology and growth compared to their wild-type counterparts, but they show strongly enhanced resistance to both bacterial leaf blight, rice blast, and attack of white-backed planthoppers. Caffeine acts as a repellent agent against rice pathogens. Moreover, caffeine triggers a series of Ca2+ signalling-like processes to synthesize salicylic acid (SA), a hormone associated with plant resistance. In CPR, phosphodiesterase was inhibited by caffeine, cAMP and cGMP increased, intracellular Ca2+ increased, phenylalanine lyase (PAL) was activated by OsCPK1, and SA synthesis was activated.

The human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi produces Vi antigen CPS, which contributes to virulence. In a conserved strategy used by bacteria with diverse CPS structures, translocation of Vi antigen to the cell surface is driven by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. These transporters are engaged in heterooligomeric complexes proposed to form an enclosed translocation conduit to the cell surface, allowing the transporter to power the entire process. We identified Vi antigen biosynthesis genetic loci in genera of the Burkholderiales, which are paradoxically distinguished from S. Typhi by encoding VexL, a predicted pectate lyase homolog. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that VexL is an unusual metal-independent endolyase with an acidic pH optimum that is specific for O-acetylated Vi antigen. A 1.22-A crystal structure of the VexL-Vi antigen complex revealed features which distinguish common secreted catabolic pectate lyases from periplasmic VexL, which participates in cell-surface assembly. VexL possesses a right-handed parallel beta-superhelix, of which one face forms an electropositive glycan-binding groove with an extensive hydrogen bonding network that includes Vi antigen acetyl groups and confers substrate specificity. VexL provided a probe to interrogate conserved features of the ABC transporter-dependent export model. When introduced into S Typhi, VexL localized to the periplasm and degraded Vi antigen. In contrast, a cytosolic derivative had no effect unless export was disrupted.

Using this spectroscopic approach, structural changes in carotenoids, xylan, cellulose and pectin that are associ-ated with this bacterial disease can be determined. 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a phloem-limited Gram-negative bacterium that infects crops worldwide. In North America, two haplotypes of Lso (LsoA and LsoB) are transmitted by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), and infect many solanaceous crops such as potato and tomato. Infected plants exhibit chlorosis, severe stunting, leaf cupping, and scorching. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and potato tuber frying are commonly used methods for diagnostics of the plant disease caused by Lso. However, they are time-consuming, costly, destructive to the sample, and often not sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in the early infection stage. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a noninvasive, nondestructive, analytical technique, which probes chemical composition of analyzed samples.

Resistant rhizobia used for phytoremediation could act on metals directly by chelation, precipitation, transformation, biosorption and accumulation. Moreover, the plant growth promoting (PGP) traits of rhizobia including nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, phytohormone synthesis, siderophore release, and production of ACC deaminase and the volatile compounds of acetoin and 2, 3-butanediol may facilitate legume growth while lessening metal toxicity.

Using this mechanism, GroEL assists folding of about 10-15 % of cellular proteins. Surprisingly, about 30 % of the bacteria express multiple chaperonin genes. The presence of multiple chaperonins raises questions on whether they increase general chaperoning ability in the cell or have developed specific novel cellular roles.

To achieve this objective, a systematic study was carried out to identify media components and culture conditions for efficient embryogenic callus induction from the mature seeds and differentiation of callus into plantlets from two North-East deep water rice cultivars, Taothabi and Khongan. Also, role of preculture of callus on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was studied.

Hitherto seven species of cockroaches were known from the Maltese Archipelago (Schembri 1980): four of them are synanthropic species introduced by man: Blatta orientalis, Blattella germanica, Periplaneta americana and Supella longipalpa; the remaining three are indigenous species: Ectobius kraussianus, Loboptera decipiens and Polyphaga aegyptiaca. The earlier reports almost exclusively concern the largest island Malta; only one report (L. decipiens) applies to the islet Comino. Faunistic part. By recent collectings of the authors (mainly A.S.) including also the smaller islands Gozo, Comino and some rock islets (Cominotto, Filfla, Fungus Rock, Large Blue Lagoon Rock, Pigean Rock) the known distribution of the species could be largely widened; two further obviously indigenous species were found, both new to science and presumably endemic to Malta: Ectobius melitensis, sp. nov. (Ectobiidae, Ectobiinae) and Heterogamisca jeffreyana, sp. nov. (Corydiidae, Corydiinae). E. kraussianus presumably has to be eliminated from the list of Maltese cockroaches; the older report most likely concerns a misidentified E. melitensis. During the last years the number of introduced species was strongly increased (1) by escapees of species cultivated for the nourishment of amphibia and reptilia, as are Blaptica dubia, Gromphadorhina sp., Nauphoeta cinerea, Periplaneta fuliginosa, Shelfordella lateralis and Symploce pallens, and (2) by species presumably imported with gardening materials: Pycnoscelus surinamensis and Phoetalia pallida. The mentioned species have repeatedly been found in human buildings and adjacent gardens of a number of settlements, mostly in the surroundings of the capital Valetta. They seem to be well established there; part of them has even been observed in the wild. The newly introduced species are in spite of their successful establishment and reproduction in Malta not considered as a danger for the indigenous species: The great differences in the requirements between the two groups most likely exclude competition between them. Three species, Ectobius vittiventris, Henschoutedenis flexivitta, and Periplaneta australasiae, have only occasionally been found and can, therefore, scarcely be considered as members of the Maltese fauna; the latter also applies to species of the genus Panchlora which were repeatedly observed on fruit markets at freshly imported bananas, but never found outside, neither in the Maltese banana plantations.

Here we introduce an unsupervised, systems-oriented approach to identify key members of the microbiota. We used two CF sputum microbiome data sets that were longitudinally collected through periods spanning baseline health and PEs. Key taxa were defined based on three strategies: overall relative abundance, prevalence, and co-occurrence network interconnectedness. We measured the association between changes in the abundance of the key taxa and changes in patient clinical status over time via change-point detection, and found that taxa with the highest level of network interconnectedness tracked changes in patient health significantly better than taxa with the highest abundance or prevalence. We also cross-sectionally stratified all samples into the clinical states and identified key taxa associated with each state. We found that network interconnectedness most strongly delineated the taxa among clinical states, and that anaerobic bacteria were over-represented during PEs. Many of these anaerobes are oropharyngeal bacteria that have been previously isolated from the respiratory tract, and/or have been studied for their role in CF.

Leptocybe invasa is an invasive pest that causes serious damage to eucalyptus plantations, and the thelytokous parthenogenesis, low temperature resistance, protection in galls, generation overlap and small body of L. invasa contribute to its rapid invasion and population growth. However, the endosymbiotic bacterial composition, abundance and sex differences of L. invasa remain unclear. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the bacterial communities in L. invasa adults and compare them between the sexes of L. invasa lineage B.RESULTS: The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to compare bacterial community composition between females and males of L. invasa by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. A total of 1,320 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. These OTUs were subdivided into 24 phyla, 71 classes, 130 orders, 245 families and 501 genera. At the genus level, the dominant bacteria in females and males were Rickettsia and Rhizobium, respectively.CONCLUSION: The endosymbiotic bacteria of L. invasa females and males were highly diverse. There were differences in the bacterial community of L. invasa between sexes, and the bacterial diversity in male specimens was greater than that in female specimens.

This approach is based on a human artificial chromosome made of long synthetic repetitive DNA sequences in which we manipulated the chromatin by tethering the modifiers. However, a method for introducing long repetitive DNA sequences into plants has not yet been established. Therefore, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based binary vector in Escherichia coli cells to generate a construct in which a cassette of marker genes was inserted into 60-kb synthetic human centromeric repetitive DNA. The binary vector was then transferred to Agrobacterium cells and its stable maintenance confirmed. Next, using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, this construct was successfully introduced into the genome of cultured tobacco BY-2 cells to obtain a large number of stable one-copy strains. ChIP analysis of obtained BY-2 cell lines revealed that the introduced synthetic repetitive DNA has moderate chromatin modification levels with lower heterochromatin (H3K9me2) or euchromatin (H3K4me3) modifications compared to the host centromeric repetitive DNA or an active Tub6 gene, respectively.

Based on typing of several loci, we showed that these two strains, although closely related and originally sampled in Australia, evolved differently. One strain was recovered in soil with the same five loci as the original isolate, whereas the symbiotic cluster of the other strain was detected with no trace of the three housekeeping genes of the original inoculum. Moreover, the nitrogen fixation efficiency was variable among these isolates (either recombinant or not), with significantly high, low, or similar efficiencies compared to the two original strains and no significant difference between recombinant and nonrecombinant isolates.

The role of McSnRK1 in controlling Na+ influx and Na/K ratio was demonstrated. SnRK1 kinases (SNF1-related protein kinase1) control metabolic adaptation during energy deprivation and regulate protective mechanisms against environmental stress. Yeast SNF1 activates a P-type ATPase, the Na+ exclusion pump, under glucose starvation. The involvement of plant SnRK1 in salt stress response is largely unknown. We previously identified a salt-induced McSnRK1 in the halophyte ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum). In the current study, the function of McSnRK1 in salt tolerance was analyzed in transgenic cultured cells and roots of ice plant. Ice plant callus constitutively expressed a high level of McSnRK1 and introducing the full-length McSnRK1 did not alter the Na/K ratio at 24h after 200mM NaCl treatment. However, interfering with McSnRK1 activity by introducing a truncate McSnRK1 to produce a dominant-negative form of McSnRK1 increased cellular Na+ accumulation and Na/K ratio. As a result, the growth of cultured cells diminished under salt treatment. Hydroponically grown ice plants with roots expressing full-length McSnRK1 had better growth and lowered Na/K ratio compared to the wild-type or vector-only plants. Roots expressing a truncate McSnRK1 had reduced growth and high Na/K ratio under 400mM NaCl treatment. The changes in Na/K ratio in transgenic cells and whole plants demonstrated the function of SnRK1 in controlling Na+ flux and maintaining Na/K homeostasis under salinity.

We utilized a library of uniquely barcoded B. abortus strains to temporally and spatially quantify population structure during colonization of cattle through a natural route of infection. Introducing 108 bacteria from this barcoded library to the conjunctival mucosa resulted in expected levels of local lymph node colonization at a 1-wk time point. We leveraged variance in strain abundance in the library to demonstrate that only 1 in 10,000 brucellae introduced at the site of infection reached a parotid lymph node. Thus, cattle restrict the overwhelming majority of B. abortus introduced via the ocular conjunctiva at this dose. Individual strains were spatially restricted within the host tissue, and the total B. abortus census was dominated by a small number of distinct strains in each lymph node. These results define a bottleneck that B. abortus must traverse to colonize local lymph nodes from the conjunctival mucosa.

Here we reported metabolic engineering of C. sativa to synthesize red ketocarotenoids that could serve as a reporter to visualize transgenic events without using a traditional SMG. Overexpression of a non-native beta-carotene ketolase gene coupled with three other carotenogenous genes (phytoene synthase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, and Orange) in C. sativa resulted in production of red seeds that were visibly distinguishable from the normal yellow ones. Constitutive expression of the transgenes led to delayed plant development and seed germination. In contrast, seed-specific transformants demonstrated normal growth and seed germination despite the accumulation of up to 70-fold the level of carotenoids in the seeds compared to the controls, including significant amounts of astaxanthin and keto-lutein.

It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85,p<10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4,p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56,p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis.

Recent whole-genome sequencing efforts have uncovered putative components of RSI-like invasion switches in many other symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. To explore the possibility of the existence of a common invasion switch, we have conducted a phylogenomic survey of orthologous ExoR, ExoS, and ChvI tripartite sets in more than ninety proteobacterial genomes. Our analyses suggest that functional orthologs of the RSI invasion switch co-exist in Rhizobiales, an order characterized by numerous invasive species, but not in the order's close relatives. Phylogenomic analyses and reconstruction of orthologous sets of the three proteins in Alphaproteobacteria confirm Rhizobiales-specific gene synteny and congruent RSI evolutionary histories. Evolutionary analyses further revealed site-specific substitutions correlated specifically to either animal-bacteria or plant-bacteria associations. Lineage restricted conservation of any one specialized gene is in itself an indication of species adaptation. However, the orthologous phylogenetic co-occurrence of all interacting partners within this single signaling pathway strongly suggests that the development of the RSI switch was a key adaptive mechanism.

Commercial RAS must be allowed to equilibrate following installation, before fish can be introduced. There is little information available regarding the bacterial community structure in commercial zebrafish housing systems, or the time-point at which the system or biofilter reaches a microbiological equilibrium in RAS in general.METHODS: A zebrafish housing system was monitored at multiple different system sites including tank water in six different tanks, pre- and post-particulate filter water, the fluidized bed biofilter substrate, post-carbon filter water, and water leaving the ultra-violet (UV) disinfection unit and entering the tanks. All of these samples were collected in quadruplicate, from prior to population of the system with zebrafish through 18weeks post-population, and analyzed using both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and culture using multiple agars and annotation of isolates via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Sequencing data were analyzed using traditional methods, network analyses of longitudinal data, and integration of culture and sequence data.RESULTS: The water microbiome, dominated by Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus spp., reached a relatively stable richness and composition by approximately three to four weeks post-population, but continued to evolve in composition throughout the study duration. The microbiomes of the fluidized bed biofilter and water leaving the UV disinfection unit were distinct from water at all other sites. Core taxa detected using molecular methods comprised 36 amplicon sequence variants, 15 of which represented Proteobacteria including multiple members of the families Burkholderiaceae and Sphingomonadaceae. Culture-based screening yielded 36 distinct isolates, and showed moderate agreement with sequencing data.CONCLUSIONS: The microbiome of commercial RAS used for research zebrafish reaches a relatively stable state by four weeks post-population and would be expected to be suitable for experimental use following that time-point.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,NA,NA,,2524-4671,NA,MEDLINE:34353374,34353374,NA

Morphogenesis, including hyphal growth, conidiation, and cell wall biosynthesis is crucial in A. fumigatus pathogenesis. Based on a previous random insertional mutagenesis library, we identified the putative polysaccharide synthase gene Afcps1 and its para-log Afcps2. Homologs of the cps gene are commonly found in the genomes of most fungal and some bacterial pathogens. Afcps1/cpsA is important in sporulation, cell wall composition, and virulence. However, the precise regulation patterns of cell wall integrity by Afcps1/cpsA and further effects on the immune response are poorly understood. Specifically, our in-depth study revealed that Afcps1 affects cell-wall stability, showing an increased resistance of DeltaAfcps1 to the chitinmicrofibril destabilizing compound calcofluor white (CFW) and susceptibility of DeltaAfcps1 to the beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase inhibitor echinocandin caspofungin (CS). Additionally, deletion of Afcps2 had a normal sporulation phenotype but caused hypersensitivity to Na+ stress, CFW, and Congo red (CR). Specifically, quantitative analysis of cell wall composition using high-performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detector (HPAEC-PAD) analysis revealed that depletion of Afcps1 reduced cell wall glucan and chitin contents, which was consistent with the down-regulation of expression of the corresponding biosynthesis genes. Moreover, an elevated immune response stimulated by conidia of the DeltaAfcps1 mutant in marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) during phagocytosis was observed. Thus, our study provided new insights into the function of polysaccharide synthase Cps1, which is necessary for the maintenance of cell wall stability and the adaptation of conidia to the immune response of macrophages in A. fumigatus.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,NA,NA,,1976-3794,NA,MEDLINE:33201436,33201436,NA

Two strategies were evaluated for the development of chimeric LysR-type biosensors with customized ligand specificity profiles toward three closely related flavonoids, naringenin, apigenin, and luteolin. In the first strategy, chimeric promoter regions were constructed at the biosensor effector module, while in the second strategy, chimeric transcription factors were created at the biosensor detector module. Via both strategies, the biosensor repertoire was expanded with luteolin-specific chimeric biosensors demonstrating a variety of response curves and ligand specificity profiles. Starting from the nonspecific biosensor chassis, a shift from 27.5% to 95.3% luteolin specificity was achieved with the created chimeric biosensors.

However, crossbreeding is a labor-intensive process that requires between 5 and 7 years to develop a new variety. More recently, genome editing with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has been established as an efficient method to accelerate the breeding process by introducing targeted modifications to plant genomes via generation of targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs). CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to generate a variety of specific changes ranging from gene knockouts to gene replacements, and can also be easily multiplexed to modify several targets simultaneously. Given that (1) generating knockout mutations only requires a DSB that is frequently repaired by the error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway resulting in gene function inactivation, and (2) the genetic basis of many useful agronomic traits consists of loss of gene function, multiple traits can be created in a plant in one generation by simultaneously introducing DSBs into multiple genes of interest. On the other hand, more precise modifications, such as allele replacement, can be achieved by gene targeting-a less efficient process in which an external template is used to repair the DSB by homologous recombination (HR). These technical breakthroughs allow the design and customization of plant traits to achieve the ideal plant type (ideotype).

Merr) grown in the USA. Because of its significance as a microsymbiont of this economically important legume, B. elkanii USDA 76T was selected as part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute 2010 Genomic Encyclopedia for Bacteria and Archaea-Root Nodule Bacteria sequencing project. Here the symbiotic abilities of B. elkanii USDA 76T are described, together with its genome sequence information and annotation. The 9,484,767 bphigh-quality draft genome is arranged in 2 scaffolds of 25 contigs, containing 9060 protein-coding genes and 91 RNA-only encoding genes. The B. elkanii USDA 76T genome contains a low GC content region with symbiotic nod and fix genes, indicating the presence of a symbiotic island integration. A comparison of five B. elkanii genomes that formed a clique revealed that 356 of the 9060 protein coding genes of USDA 76T were unique, including 22 genes of an intact resident prophage. A conserved set of 7556 genes were also identified for this species, including genes encoding a general secretion pathway as well as type II, III, IV and VI secretion system proteins. The type III secretion system has previously been characterized as a host determinant for Rj and/or rj soybean cultivars. Here we show that the USDA 76T genome contains genes encoding all the type III secretion system components, including a translocon complex protein NopX required for the introduction of effector proteins into host cells. While many bradyrhizobial strains are unable to nodulate the soybean cultivar Clark (rj1), USDA 76T was able to elicit nodules on Clark (rj1), although in reduced numbers, when plants were grown in Leonard jars containing sand or vermiculite. In these conditions, we postulate that the presence of NopX allows USDA 76T to introduce various effector molecules into this host to enable nodulation.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,NA,NA,1944-3277,,NA,MEDLINE:28270909,28270909,NA

However, most of the root study methods have paid little attention to make and preserve whole root specimens. This study introduces root system sampling equipment that makes the entire root specimen with minimum impairment and without displacement of the spatial arrangement of the root system in root boxes. The objectives are to assess: whether the equipment can rapidly sample the entire root system; whether root surface area is measurable from a scanned digital image of the root specimen; and whether staining of the entire root specimens would provide multidimensional visual information on the interaction between soil and physiological function of root system architecture (RSA). For validation, we examined the root response of two soybean cultivars to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation and the effect of waterlogging stress on the physiological activity of buckwheat RSA.RESULTS: The root boxes allowed soybean and buckwheat plants to grow uniformly across the replications. Both species showed significant differences between cultivars and/or among treatments in shoot and root traits. The equipment enabled to sample the whole-root specimens of soybean and buckwheat, where the tips of the fine roots were alive (diameter <0.2mm). Also, the whole root specimens of soybean were made in about 7min. The root surface area calculated from the scanned soybean specimens showed a significant correlation with that calculated from the roots spread out in water (a common method). Staining of the soybean root specimens enabled us to observe the localized root proliferation induced by AM colonization. Moreover, staining of the buckwheat root specimens made it possible to examine the respiratory activity of each root at different depths.CONCLUSIONS: The present method realized: fast and accurate production of the whole root specimen and precise calculation of the specimens' root surface area.

One such restorer gene is Rfo, which restores fertility to the radish Ogura or ogu CMS. Rfo, like most characterized restorers, encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, a family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by tandem repeats of a 35 amino acid motif. While over 400 PPR genes are found in characterized plant genomes and the importance of this gene family in organelle gene expression is widely recognized, few detailed in vivo assessments of primary structure-function relationships in this protein family have been conducted.RESULTS: In contrast to earlier studies, which identified 16 or 17 PPR domains in the Rfo protein, we now find, using a more recently developed predictive tool, that Rfo has 18 repeat domains with the additional domain N-terminal to the others. Comparison of transcript sequences from pooled rfo/rfo plants with pooled Rfo/Rfo plants of a mapping population led to the identification of a non-restoring rfo allele with a 12 bp deletion in the fourth domain. Introduction into ogu CMS plants of a genetic construct in which this deletion had been introduced into Rfo led to a partial loss in the capacity to produce viable pollen, as assessed by vital staining, pollen germination and the capacity for seed production following pollination of CMS plants. The degree of viable pollen production among different transgenic plants roughly correlated with the copy number of the introduced gene and with the reduction of the levels of the ORF138 CMS-associated protein. All other constructs tested, including one in which only the C-terminal PPR repeat was deleted and another in which this repeat was replaced by the corresponding domain of the related, non-restoring gene, PPR-A, failed to result in any measure of fertility restoration.CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the additional PPR domain in Rfo indicates that the protein, apart from its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence, consists almost entirely of PPR repeats. The newly identified rfo allele carries the same 4 amino acid deletion as that found in the neighboring, related, non-restoring PPR gene, PPR-A. Introduction of this four amino acid deletion into a central domain the Rfo protein, however, only partially reduces its restoration capacity, even though this alteration might be expected to alter the spacing between the adjoining repeats. All other tested alterations, generated by deleting specific PPR repeats or exchanging repeats with corresponding domains of PPR-A, led to a complete loss of restorer function. Overall we demonstrate that introduction of targeted alterations of Rfo into ogu CMS plants provides a sensitive in vivo readout for analysis of the relationship between primary structure and biological function in this important family of plant proteins.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,2,1,0,6,0,11,NA,NA,,1471-2229,NA,MEDLINE:25403785,25403785,NA

The local variety, Mekna, developed significantly more root nodules and had a trapping capacity in more soils than the imported variety Lumen. A phylogenetic analysis based on the partial 16S-23S ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of three chromosomal housekeeping genes, recA, atpD and dnaK, showed that strains were affiliated to Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, and Neorhizobium, with large internal diversity, including separate lineages. Infectivity tests highlighted some nodulation specificity at the plant variety level, since the strains originating from Mekna could only nodulate this variety, while strains trapped in Lumen could nodulate both varieties. When inoculated, almost all strains resulted in a significant increase in plant shoot dry weight on L. albus. Although Agrobacterium sp. strains isolated from L. albus could nodulate and had a plant growth promoting effect, no nodA and nodC genes could be amplified. This is discussed together with the absence of bradyrhizobia and the general infrequency of L. albus-nodulating rhizobia in Tunisian soils.

The purpose of the work was to investigate the impact of combined application of fungi- cides with inoculation on the soybean symbiotic system and rhizosphere microorganisms. The Methods. The microbiological and statistical methods, gas chromatography method. The Results. Inoculation of seeds by the highly active Bradyrhizobiumjaponicum UCM B-6035, UCM B-6018 and UCM B-6023 strains the activity of nitrogen-fixing symbiotic systems increased by 1.4-3.4 times in comparison with the variant without of fungicides application and bacterization. Seed treatment by Vitavaks 200 FF fungicide caused a de- crease of'nitrogen-fixing activity of rhizobia industrial strains in symbiosis with soybean by 3-5 times. The seeds inoculation by B. japonicum UCM B-6035 strain promoted to reduce the negative impact of the Maxim Star 025 FS fungicide on the nitrogenase activity of nodulation apparatus. The positive effect of seeds bacterization was observed in the in- crease of the quantity of rhizosphere microorganisms of main ecological trophic groups. In the variant with seed treatment by Maxim Star 025 FS and Kinto duo fungicides was found a decrease in the number of microorganisms of studied groups in comparison with the control variant; the Vitavaks 200 FF fungicide application promoted to improve of these microorganisms development compared with the variant without the fungicides application and bacterization. At the inoculation of rhizobia industrial strains the negative effect of the Maxim Star 025 FS and Kinto duo fungicides to oligoazotrophic and prototrophic micro- organisms was not observed. The Conclusion.

In this study, we present the first application of genome editing technology in cacao, using Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation to introduce CRISPR/Cas9 components into cacao leaves and cotyledon cells. As a first proof of concept, we targeted the cacao Non-Expressor of Pathogenesis-Related 3 (TcNPR3) gene, a suppressor of the defense response. After demonstrating activity of designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) in vitro, we used Agrobacterium to introduce a CRISPR/Cas9 system into leaf tissue, and identified the presence of deletions in 27% of TcNPR3 copies in the treated tissues. The edited tissue exhibited an increased resistance to infection with the cacao pathogen Phytophthora tropicalis and elevated expression of downstream defense genes. Analysis of off-target mutagenesis in sequences similar to sgRNA target sites using high-throughput sequencing did not reveal mutations above background sequencing error rates. These results confirm the function of NPR3 as a repressor of the cacao immune system and demonstrate the application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful functional genomics tool for cacao.

Accumulating epidemiological evidence indicates a causal association with risk of bacterial co-infection, rather than just co-incidence of common risk factors. Both malaria and Oroya fever are characterized by hemolysis, and observations in humans and animal models suggest that hemolysis causes the susceptibility to bacterial co-infection. Evidence from animal models implicates hemolysis in the impairment of a variety of host defense mechanisms, including macrophage dysfunction, neutrophil dysfunction, and impairment of adaptive immune responses. One mechanism supported by evidence from animal models and human data, is the induction of heme oxygenase-1 in bone marrow, which impairs the ability of developing neutrophils to mount a competent oxidative burst. As a result, dysfunctional neutrophils become a new niche for replication of intracellular bacteria.

We have used a bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase, SorT, which lacks an internal heme group, but transfers electrons to an external, electron accepting cytochrome, SorU, to investigate the molecular functions of this arginine residue (Arg78). Assay of the SorT Mo centre catalytic competency in the absence of SorU showed that substitutions in the central arginine (R78Q, R78K and R78M mutations) only moderately altered SorT catalytic properties, except for R78M which caused significant reduction in SorT activity. The substitutions also altered the Mo-centre redox potentials (MoVI/V potential lowered by ca. 60-80mV). However, all Arg78 mutations significantly impaired the ability of SorT to transfer electrons to SorU, where activities were reduced 17 to 46-fold compared to SorTWT, precluding determination of kinetic parameters. This was accompanied by the observation of conformational changes in both the introduced Gln and Lys residues in the crystal structure of the enzymes. Taking into account data collected by others on related SOE mutations we propose that the formation and maintenance of an electron transfer complex between the Mo centre and electron accepting heme groups is the main function of the central arginine, and that the reduced turnover and increases in KMsulfite are caused by the inefficient operation of the oxidative half reaction of the catalytic cycle in enzymes carrying these mutations.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,NA,NA,0005-2728,,NA,MEDLINE:28986298,28986298,NA

Decreased TK activity decreased the photosynthetic rate, seed germination rate, growth yield, and the tolerance to low temperature and weak light stress. Transketolase (TK, EC 2.2.1.1) is a key enzyme in the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle (Calvin cycle). A cDNA fragment (526 bp) encoding transketolase was cloned from cucumber plants (Cucumis sativa L. cv 'Jinyou 3') by RT-PCR. The antisense expression [(PBI-CsTK(-)] vector containing the CsTK gene fragment was constructed. The resulting plasmid was introduced into the cucumber inbred lines '08-1' using the agrobacterium-mediated method, and four antisense transgenic cucumber plants were obtained. Decreased CsTK expression either unaltered or slightly increased the mRNA abundance and activities of the other main enzymes in the Calvin cycle, however, it decreased the TK activity and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in antisense transgenic cucumber leaves. Antisense plants showed decreases in the growth, ratio of female flowers and yield compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. The decrease in Pn, stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (PhiPSII) and the increase in electrolyte leakage (EL) were greater in antisense transgenic plants than in WT plants under low temperature (5 °C) and low light intensity (100 mumol m(-2) s(-1)).",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23,2,0,0,18,0,25,NA,NA,,1432-203X,NA,MEDLINE:25471346,25471346,NA

To ensure the early detection of any brucellosis outbreak, event-driven surveillance relies on the mandatory notification of bovine abortions and the brucellosis testing of aborting cows. However, the under-reporting of abortions appears frequent. Our objectives were to assess the aptitude of the bovine abortion surveillance system to detect each and every bovine abortion and to identify factors influencing the system's effectiveness. We evaluated five attributes defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control with a method suited to each attribute: (1) data quality was studied quantitatively and qualitatively, as this factor considerably influences data analysis and results; (2) sensitivity and representativeness were estimated using a unilist capture-recapture approach to quantify the surveillance system's effectiveness; (3) acceptability and simplicity were studied through qualitative interviews of actors in the field, given that the surveillance system relies heavily on abortion notifications by farmers and veterinarians. Our analysis showed that (1) data quality was generally satisfactory even though some errors might be due to actors' lack of awareness of the need to collect accurate data; (2) from 2006 to 2011, the mean annual sensitivity - i.e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion out of all those who detected such events - was around 34%, but was significantly higher in dairy than beef cattle herds (highlighting a lack of representativeness); (3) overall, the system's low sensitivity was related to its low acceptability and lack of simplicity. This study showed that, in contrast to policy-makers, most farmers and veterinarians perceived the risk of a brucellosis outbreak as negligible. They did not consider sporadic abortions as a suspected case of brucellosis and usually reported abortions only to identify their cause rather than to reject brucellosis. The system proved too complex, especially for beef cattle farmers, as they may fail to detect aborting cows at pasture or have difficulties catching them for sampling. By investigating critical attributes, our evaluation highlighted the surveillance system's strengths and needed improvements. We believe our comprehensive approach can be used to assess other event-driven surveillance systems. In addition, some of our recommendations on increasing the effectiveness of event-driven brucellosis surveillance may be useful in improving the notification rate for suspected cases of other exotic diseases.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,0,0,0,7,0,10,NA,NA,,1873-1716,NA,MEDLINE:25748002,25748002,NA

To find rhizobia associated with Anthyllis at a given site, we evaluated the genetic and phenotypic properties of a collection of 137 rhizobia recovered from soils presenting contrasting metal levels. Zn-Pb mine soils largely contained metal-tolerant rhizobia belonging to Mesorhizobium metallidurans or to another sister metal-tolerant species. All of the metal-tolerant isolates harbored the cadA marker gene (encoding a metal-efflux PIB-type ATPase transporter). In contrast, metal-sensitive strains were taxonomically distinct from metal-tolerant populations and consisted of new Mesorhizobium genospecies. Based on the symbiotic nodA marker, the populations comprise two symbiovar assemblages (potentially related to Anthyllis or Lotus host preferences) according to soil geographic locations but independently of metal content. Multivariate analysis showed that soil Pb and Cd concentrations differentially impacted the rhizobial communities and that a rhizobial community found in one geographically distant site was highly divergent from the others. In conclusion, heavy metal levels in soils drive the taxonomic composition of Anthyllis-associated rhizobial populations according to their metal-tolerance phenotype but not their symbiotic nodA diversity. In addition to heavy metals, local soil physicochemical and topoclimatic conditions also impact the rhizobial beta diversity. Mesorhizobium communities were locally adapted and site specific, and their use is recommended for the success of phytostabilization strategies based on Mesorhizobium-legume vegetation.IMPORTANCE: Phytostabilization of toxic mine spoils limits heavy metal dispersion and environmental pollution by establishing a sustainable plant cover. This eco-friendly method is facilitated by the use of selected and adapted cover crop legumes living in symbiosis with rhizobia that can stimulate plant growth naturally through biological nitrogen fixation. We studied microsymbiont partners of a metal-tolerant legume, Anthyllis vulneraria, which is tolerant to very highly metal-polluted soils in mining and nonmining sites. Site-specific rhizobial communities were linked to taxonomic composition and metal tolerance capacity. The rhizobial species Mesorhizobium metallidurans was dominant in all Zn-Pb mines but one. It was not detected in unpolluted sites where other distinct Mesorhizobium species occur. Given the different soil conditions at the respective mining sites, including their heavy-metal contamination, revegetation strategies based on rhizobia adapting to local conditions are more likely to succeed over the long term compared to strategies based on introducing less-well-adapted strains.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16,0,0,0,15,0,16,NA,NA,,1098-5336,NA,MEDLINE:27793823,27793823,NA

The activation state of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, a key enzyme in starch synthesis, was higher in antisense roots than in roots overexpressing NDPK1. Further analyses demonstrated that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was more oxidized, and therefore less active, in sense clones than antisense clones.

The MET14 (CNE03880) gene was also identified, which is responsible for the conversion of sulfate to sulfite. The use of cysteine as a sulfur source led to the production of methionine via hydrogen sulfide synthesis mediated by CYS4 (CNA06170), CYS3 (CNN01730), and MST1 (CND03690). MST1 exhibited high homology with the TUM1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has functional similarity with the 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) gene in humans. Although the hypothesis that hydrogen sulfide is produced from cysteine via CYS4, CYS3, and MST1 warrants further study, the new insight into the metabolic pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids in C. neoformans provided here indicates the usefulness of this system in the development of screening tools for antifungal drug agents.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,,1432-0983,NA,MEDLINE:33001274,33001274,NA

Deltahog1 resistance to FD confirmed that Hog1 mediates the activity of FD, whereas Deltakss1 sensitivity is probably due to the basal activation of Hog1 in Deltakss1.

Horizontal gene transfer from unrelated organisms has occurred in the course of plant evolution, suggesting that some foreign genes may be useful to plants. The CtHSR1 gene, previously isolated from the halophytic yeast Candida tropicalis, encodes a heat-shock transcription factor-related protein. CtHSR1, with expression driven by its own promoter or by the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter, was introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and the resulting transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought than controls. Fusions of the CtHSR1 promoter with beta-glucuronidase reporter gene indicated that this fungal promoter drives expression to phloem tissues. A chimera of CtHSR1 and green fluorescence protein is localized at the cell nucleus. The physiological mechanism of drought tolerance in transgenic plants is based on reduced transpiration (which correlates with decreased opening of stomata and increased levels of jasmonic acid) and increased osmotic potential (which correlates with increased proline accumulation). Transcriptomic analysis indicates that the CtHSR1 transgenic plants overexpressed a hundred of genes, including many relevant to stress defense such as LOX4 (involved in jasmonic acid synthesis) and P5CS1 (involved in proline biosynthesis). The promoters of the induced genes were enriched in upstream activating sequences for water stress induction. These results demonstrate that genes from unrelated organisms can have functional expression in plants from its own promoter and expand the possibilities of useful transgenes for plant biotechnology.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,4,0,0,3,0,7,NA,NA,,1432-2048,NA,MEDLINE:25809153,25809153,NA

However, the high levels of lignins in rice straw limited its usage and induced the formation of agricultural waste. In order to modify the lignins contents to improve biofuel production and forage digestibility, we selected Soybean hull peroxidase (SHP) and Glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) as candidate genes to improve quality of rice straw. SHP, a class III plant peroxidase, is derived from multiple sources. It has several advantages, such as high resistance to heat, high stability under acidic and alkaline conditions, and a broad substrate range. SHP is speculated to be useful for lignin degradation. Glyoxal oxidase (GLOX) is an extracellular oxidase that can oxidize glyoxal and methylglyoxal in the extracellular medium to generate H2O2.RESULTS: In the present study, the SHP and GLOX genes in pCAMBIA3301-glycine-rich protein (GRP)-SHP-GLOX, designated the K167 vector, were optimized and introduced into rice embryos using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Positive transgenic rice embryos were examined using molecular, physiological, biochemical and fermentation tests. The outcomes suggested that SHP degraded lignin effectively.CONCLUSIONS: This research has created a rice breeding material with normal growth and yield but stalks that are more amenable to degradation in the later stage for use in breeding rice varieties whose stalks are easily used for energy.

Rhizobia genomes usually harbor several plasmids which can be transferred to other organisms by conjugation. Two main mechanisms of the regulation of rhizobial plasmid transfer have been described: quorum sensing (QS) and the rctA/rctB system. Nevertheless, new genes and molecules that modulate conjugative transfer have recently been described, demonstrating that new actors can tightly regulate the process. In this work, by means of bioinformatics tools and molecular biology approaches, two hypothetical genes are identified as playing key roles in conjugative transfer. These genes are located between conjugative genes of plasmid pRfaLPU83a from Rhizobium favelukesii LPU83, a plasmid that shows a conjugative transfer behavior depending on the genomic background. One of the two mentioned genes, rcgA, is essential for conjugation, while the other, rcgR, acts as an inhibitor of the process. In addition to introducing this new regulatory system, we show evidence of the functions of these genes in different genomic backgrounds and confirm that homologous proteins from non-closely related organisms have the same functions. These findings set up the basis for a new regulatory circuit of the conjugative transfer of plasmids. IMPORTANCE Extrachromosomal DNA elements, such as plasmids, allow for the adaptation of bacteria to new environments by conferring new determinants. Via conjugation, plasmids can be transferred between members of the same bacterial species, different species, or even to organisms belonging to a different kingdom. Knowledge about the regulatory systems of plasmid conjugative transfer is key in understanding the dynamics of their dissemination in the environment. As the increasing availability of genomes raises the number of predicted proteins with unknown functions, deeper experimental procedures help to elucidate the roles of these determinants.

A screening of desaturase-deficient mutants showed that a single desaturase belonging to the acyl-CoA desaturase (ADS) family, previously reported as ADS4.2, was responsible for introducing double bonds en route to the wax alkenes. ADS4.2 was highly expressed in young leaves, especially in trichomes, where the alkenes are known to accumulate.

MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2 were expressed mainly in stem and apical buds of vegetative shoots, with little expression in flower buds and young fruit. Expression of MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2 rapidly decreased during floral induction. On the other hand, transgenic Arabidopsis, which ectopically expressed MdTFL1-1 or MdTFL1-2, flowered later than wild-type plants; demonstrating their in planta capability to function redundantly as flower repressors.

New biotechnology-based breeding methods such as targeted genome editing methods are able to create custom-designed medicinal plants with different secondary metabolite profiles. For a long time, humans have used medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes and in food and other industries. Classical biotechnology techniques have been exploited in breeding medicinal plants. Now, it is time to apply faster biotechnology-based breeding methods (BBBMs) to these valuable plants. Assessment of the genetic diversity, conservation, proliferation, and overproduction are the main ways by which genetics and biotechnology can help to improve medicinal plants faster. Plant tissue culture (PTC) plays an important role as a platform to apply other BBBMs in medicinal plants. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation and artificial polyploidy induction are the main BBBMs that are directly dependent on PTC. Manageable regulation of endogens and/or transferred genes via engineered zinc-finger proteins or transcription activator-like effectors can help targeted manipulation of secondary metabolite pathways in medicinal plants. The next-generation sequencing techniques have great potential to study the genetic diversity of medicinal plants through restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technique and also to identify the genes and enzymes that are involved in the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites through precise transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq). The sequence-specific nucleases of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc-finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated (Cas) are the genome editing methods that can produce user-designed medicinal plants.

In this study, random genomic fragments from plants were introduced into rice and screened for drought tolerance in a high-throughput manner with the aim of finding novel genetic elements not exclusively limited to coding sequences. To illustrate the power of this approach, genomic libraries were constructed from four grass species, and screening a total of 50,825 transgenic rice lines for drought tolerance resulted in the identification of 12 reproducibly efficacious fragments. Of the twelve, two were from the mitochondrial genome of signal grass and ten were from the nuclear genome of buffalo grass. Subsequent sequencing and analyses revealed that the ten fragments from buffalo grass carried a similar genetic element with no significant homology to any previously characterized gene. The deduced protein sequence was rich in acidic amino acid residues in the C-terminal half, and two of the glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal half were shown to play an important role in drought tolerance.

The nucleotide sequence of MsrA2, optimized for expression in plants, was introduced into the commercial hybrid poplar Populus nigra L.*P. maximowiczii A. Henry (NM6) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgene expression was regulated by the pathogen-inducible poplar promoter win3.12T, a part of the poplar innate defense system. Most importantly, the induced accumulation of MsrA2 peptide in poplar leaves was sufficient to confer resistance against S. musiva. The antifungal resistance of plants with high MsrA2 expression and MsrA2 accumulation was strong and reproducible, and without deleterious effects on plant growth and development. These results provide an insight into development of new technologies for engineering durable disease resistance against major pathogens of poplar and other plants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,0,0,0,3,0,5,NA,NA,,1573-5028,NA,MEDLINE:31073810,31073810,NA

There is therefore a strong interest in developing bioenergy crops with reduced lignin content or altered lignin structures. Another desired trait for bioenergy crops is the ability to accumulate novel bioproducts, which would enhance the development of economically sustainable biorefineries. As previously demonstrated in the model plant Arabidopsis, expression of a 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase in plants offers the potential for decreasing lignin content and overproducing a value-added metabolic coproduct (i.e., protocatechuate) suitable for biological upgrading.RESULTS: The 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase QsuB from Corynebacterium glutamicum was expressed in the bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) using the stem-specific promoter of an O-methyltransferase gene (pShOMT) from sugarcane. The activity of pShOMT was validated in switchgrass after observation in-situ of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in stem nodes of plants carrying a pShOMT::GUS fusion construct. Under controlled growth conditions, engineered switchgrass lines containing a pShOMT::QsuB construct showed reductions of lignin content, improvements of biomass saccharification efficiency, and accumulated higher amount of protocatechuate compared to control plants. Attempts to generate transgenic switchgrass lines carrying the QsuB gene under the control of the constitutive promoter pZmUbi-1 were unsuccessful, suggesting possible toxicity issues associated with ectopic QsuB expression during the plant regeneration process.CONCLUSION: This study validates the transfer of the QsuB engineering approach from a model plant to switchgrass. We have demonstrated altered expression of two important traits: lignin content and accumulation of a co-product. We found that the choice of promoter to drive QsuB expression should be carefully considered when deploying this strategy to other bioenergy crops. Field-testing of engineered QsuB switchgrass are in progress to assess the performance of the introduced traits and agronomic performances of the transgenic plants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,NA,NA,,1471-2229,NA,MEDLINE:33478381,33478381,NA

Recent studies have identified the genes involved in the betalain biosynthesis of betanin. Amaranthin and celosianin II are abundant in the quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) hypocotyl, and amaranthin comprises glucuronic acid bound to betanin; therefore, this suggests the existence of a glucuronyltransferase involved in the synthesis of amaranthin in the quinoa hypocotyl. To identify the gene involved in amaranthin biosynthesis, we performed a BLAST analysis and phylogenetic tree analysis based on sequences homologous to flavonoid glycosyltransferase, followed by expression analysis on the quinoa hypocotyl to obtain three candidate proteins. Production of amaranthin in a transient Nicotiana benthamiana expression system was evaluated for these candidates and one was identified as having the ability to produce amaranthin. The gene encoding this protein was quinoa amaranthin synthetase 1 (CqAmaSy1).

HbICE1 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues, with highest levels in the bark, and was up-regulated when subjected to various stresses including cold, dehydration, salinity and wounding.

Among the various CRISPR nucleases of numerous bacteria and archaea, the Cas9 and Cas12a (Cpf1) systems have been largely adopted for genome editing in all living organisms due to their simplicity, as they consist of a single polypeptide nuclease with a target-recognizing RNA. However, accurate and fine-tuned genome editing remains challenging due to mismatch tolerance and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent target recognition. Therefore, this review describes how to overcome the aforementioned hurdles, which especially affect genome editing in higher organisms. Additionally, the biological significance of CRISPR-mediated microbial genome editing is discussed, and future research and development directions are also proposed.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,NA,NA,,1738-8872,NA,MEDLINE:34261850,34261850,NA

Identifying and targeting factors essential for virulence or development unique to fungal pathogens is one approach to develop novel treatments for fungal infections. In this study, we present the identification and functional characterization of a novel developmental regulator in Aspergillus fumigatus, AfMed15, which contained a conserved Med15_fungal domain, as determined by screening of a mutant library that contained more than 2,000 hygromycin-resistant A. fumigatus transformants. Downregulating the expression of Afmed15 abolished the conidiation and decreased the fungal virulence in an insect model. Strikingly, the overexpression of Afmed15 caused fungal death accompanied by intensive autophagy. RNA sequencing of an Afmed15 overexpression strain revealed that altered gene expression patterns were associated with carbon metabolism, energy metabolism, and translation. Interestingly, the addition of metal ions could partially rescue fungal death caused by the overexpression of Afmed15, indicating that disordered ion homeostasis is a potential reason for the fungal death caused by the overexpression of Afmed15 Considering that the precise expression of Afmed15 is crucial for fungal development, virulence, and survival and that no ortholog was found in humans, Afmed15 is an ideal target for antifungal-drug development.IMPORTANCE The identification and characterization of regulators essential for virulence or development constitute one approach for antifungal drug development.

Infection is a common complication for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern. It is therefore crucial to monitor AMR patterns in order to support clinical decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship strategies. Clinical microbiologists should provide annual cumulative antibiogram reports, which can be used to guide initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for the management of infections.OBJECTIVES. To analyse the cumulative antibiograms for the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) combined adult multidisciplinary ICU and high-care unit (HCU) for 2013 and 2017, compare the antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) patterns between the 2 years, and analyse the subset of blood culture isolates.METHODS. A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed of routine bacterial and fungal culture and AST data extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service laboratory information system for the ICU/HCU. Only the first diagnostic isolate of a given species per patient per year was included in the analysis. All analysis and reporting were done in accordance with the applicable Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.RESULTS. Enterobacteriaceae predominated in first-isolate cultures in 2013 (60%) and 2017 (56%). There was an overall decrease in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from 2013 (42%) to 2017 (30%) (p=0.013), accompanied by an increase in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from 2013 (4%) to 2017 (11%) (p=0.24). Although the total percentage of Acinetobacter spp. decreased in 2017 (p=0.021), the proportion of extensively drug-resistant isolates doubled to 68% in 2017 (p<0.001). The percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased significantly from 49% to 14% (p<0.001), along with a significant decrease in vancomycin-resistant enterococci from 17% to 0% (p=0.001). Candida auris increased from 0% in 2013 to 11% in 2017 (p=0.002), and non-albicans Candida spp. predominated (80%) in blood cultures in 2017 (p=0.023).CONCLUSIONS. Appropriate selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be guided by the ICU-specific antibiogram. The recommended empirical antimicrobial therapy at the CMJAH ICU/HCU based on the antibiogram analysis would include ertapenem to cover the Enterobacteriaceae. Amikacin is recommended for empirical treatment of suspected pseudomonal infections. Additional empirical antimicrobial therapy for Gram-positive organisms is not routinely advocated, and empirical antifungal therapy with amphotericin Β or micafungin is only appropriate in patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,NA,NA,2078-5135,,NA,SCIELO:S0256-95742020000100013,NA,NA

Abiotic stresses, such as soil salinity and drought, negatively affect growth, development, and yield in cotton. Gene ABP9, which encodes a bZIP transcription factor, binds to the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive-element (ABRE2) motif of the maize catalase1 gene. Its expression significantly improves tolerance in Arabidopsis to multiple abiotic stresses, but little is known about its role in cotton. In the present study, the ABP9 gene was introduced into upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivar R15 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, and 12 independent transgenic cotton lines were obtained. Cotton plants over-expressing ABP9 have enhanced tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. Under stress, they developed better root systems in a greenhouse and higher germination, reduced stomatal aperture, and stomatal density in a growth chamber. Under drought conditions, survival rate and relative water content (RWC) of transgenic cotton were higher than those of R15 plants. Under salt and osmotic stresses, chlorophyll, proline, and soluble sugar contents significantly increased in transgenic cotton leaves and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower than in R15. Overexpression of ABP9 also enhanced oxidative stress tolerance, reduced cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through increased activities of antioxidative enzymes, and alleviated oxidative damage to cell. Interestingly, ABP9 over-expressing cotton was more sensitive to exogenous ABA than R15 at seed germination, root growth, stomatal aperture, and stomatal density. Moreover, ABP9 overexpression upregulated significantly the transcription levels of stress-related genes such as GhDBP2, GhNCED2, GhZFP1, GhERF1, GhHB1, and GhSAP1 under salt treatment. Conjointly, these results showed that overexpression of ABP9 conferred enhanced tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in cotton.

Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants.

In 2015, tobacco plants exhibiting severe downward leaf curling, leaf thickening, vein swelling, yellowing and stunting were identified in fields of tobacco in Suhar Al-Batina region, Oman. These symptoms are suggestive of begomovirus (genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae) infection.METHODS: Circular DNA molecules were amplified from total DNA extracted from tobacco plants by rolling circle amplification (RCA). Viral genomes were cloned from RCA products by restriction digestion and betasatellites were cloned by PCR amplification from RCA product, using universal primers. The sequences of full-length clones were obtained by Sanger sequencing and primer walking. Constructs for the infectivity of virus and betasatellite were produced and introduced into plants by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation.RESULTS: The full-length sequences of 3 begomovirus and 3 betasatellite clones, isolated from 3 plants, were obtained. Analysis of the full-length sequences determined showed the virus to be a variant of Chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) and the betasatellite to be a variant of Tomato leaf curl betasatellite (ToLCB). Both the virus and the betasatellite isolated from tobacco show the greatest levels of sequence identity to isolates of ChiLCV and ToLCB identified in other hosts in Oman. Additionally clones of ChiLCV and ToLCB were shown, by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation, to be infectious to 3 Nicotiana species, including N. tabacum. In N. benthamiana the betasatellite was shown to change the upward leaf rolling symptoms to a severe downward leaf curl, as is typical for many monopartite begomoviruses with betasatellites.CONCLUSIONS: The leaf curl disease of tobacco in Oman was shown to be caused by ChiLCV and ToLCB.

Besides T-DNA integrated by natural transformation of plant vegetative tissues by pathogenic Agrobacterium spp., previous reports have indicated that T-DNA sequences originating from an ancestral Agrobacterium sp. are present in the genomes of all cultivated sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) varieties analyzed. Expression of an Agrobacterium-derived agrocinopine synthase (ACS) gene was detected in leaf and root tissues of sweet potato, suggesting that the plant can produce agrocinopine, a sugar-phosphodiester opine considered to be utilized by some strains of Agrobacterium spp. in crown gall. To validate the product synthesized by Ipomoea batatas ACS (IbACS), we introduced IbACS into tobacco under a constitutive promoter. High-voltage paper electrophoresis followed by alkaline silver nitrate staining detected the production of an agrocinopine-like substance in IbACS1-expressing tobacco, and further mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the product confirmed that IbACS can produce agrocinopine A from natural plant substrates. The partially purified compound was biologically active in an agrocinopine A bioassay. A 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing and meta-transcriptome analysis revealed that the rhizosphere microbial community of tobacco was affected by the expression of IbACS. A new species of Leifsonia (actinobacteria) was isolated as an enriched bacterium in the rhizosphere of IbACS1-expressing tobacco. This Leifsonia sp. can catabolize agrocinopine A produced in tobacco, indicating that the production of agrocinopine A attracts rhizosphere bacteria that can utilize this sugar-phosphodiester. These results suggest a potential role of IbACS conserved among sweet potato cultivars in manipulating their microbial community.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

There has been success in coping with diseases among EI, that are rare although recognized in Israel, in terms of screening and early identification.

There were often delays in diagnosing 'exotic' diseases that are endemic in Africa, but not well known in Israel, such as Onchocerciasis, Schistosomiasis, Strongyloidiasis, and Bartonella endocarditis, which cause severe morbidity and mortality among EI. We describe the effect on general morbidity in Israel, and how the healthcare services coped with these diseases, including obstacles, and failures and successes.

This study lays out a strategy followed for selecting a Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. trifolii strain for white clover (Trifolium repens) with competitive nodule occupancy. First, the competitiveness of native-naturalized rhizobia strains selected for their efficiency to fix N2 in clover and tagged with gusA was evaluated in controlled conditions with different soils. Second, three of these experimental strains with superior nodule occupancy plus the currently recommended commercial inoculant, an introduced strain, were tested in the field in 2 years and at two sites. Plant establishment, herbage productivity, fixation of atmospheric N2 (15N natural abundance), and nodule occupancy (ERIC-PCR genomic fingerprinting) were measured. In both years and sites, nodule occupancy of the native-naturalized experimental strains was either higher or similar to that of the commercial inoculant in both primary and secondary roots. The difference was even greater in stolon roots nodules, where nodule occupancy of the native-naturalized experimental strains was at least five times greater.

Translocation of pathogens follow migration of species and alternations in physical environmental parameters may have influence upon the virulence of pathogens, as well as the hosts immune responses. While pathogenicity of many true pathogens is expected to increase following climate induced temperature stress, the impact from environmental stressors on the occurrence and severity of opportunistic infections is unknown. Here we describe how thermal stress in the cold-water species Atlantic cod influenced the fish immune responses against an opportunistic intracellular bacterium. Following experimental infection with Brucella pinnipedialis at normal water temperature (6°C) and sub-optimal temperature (15°C), cod cleared the intracellular bacteria more rapidly at the highest temperature. The overall immune response was faster and of higher amplitude at 15°C, however, a significant number of cod died at this temperature despite efficient clearance of infection. An increased growth rate not affected by infection was observed at 15°C, confirming multiple energy demanding processes taking place. Serum chemistry suggested that general homeostasis was influenced by both infection and increased water temperature, highlighting the cumulative stress responses (allostatic load) generated by simultaneous stressors. Our results suggest a trade-off between resistance and tolerance to survive infection at sub-optimal temperatures and raise questions concerning the impact of increased water temperatures on the energetic costs of immune system activation in aquatic ectotherms.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12,0,0,0,12,0,13,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:30564213,30564213,NA

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce knockout mutations in the tef orthologue of the rice SEMIDWARF-1 (SD-1) gene to confer semidwarfism and ultimately lodging resistance. High frequency recovery of transgenic and SD-1 edited tef lines was achieved in two tef cultivars by Agrobacterium-mediated delivery into young leaf explants of gene editing reagents along with transformation and regeneration enhancing morphogenic genes, BABY BOOM (BBM) and WUSCHEL2 (WUS2).

In nature, insertion of T-DNA into the plant genome and its subsequent transfer via sexual reproduction have been shown for several species in the genera Nicotiana, Ipomoea , and Linaria . A sequence homologous to T-DNA of the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes was found in the genome of wild-type Nicotiana glauca (section Noctiflorae) more than 30years ago and was named cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA). It comprises an imperfect inverted repeat and contains homologs of several T-DNA oncogenes (NgrolB, NgrolC, Ngorf13, Ngorf14) and an opine synthesis gene (Ngmis). Multiple cT-DNAs have also been found in species of the sections Tomentosae and Nicotiana of the genus Nicotiana. These ancient cT-DNA genes are still expressed, indicating that they may play a role in the evolution of these plants. In 2012-2013, cT-DNA was detected and characterized in Linaria vulgaris and L. genistifolia ssp. dalmatica. Their cT-DNA is present in two copies and organized as an imperfect direct tandem repeat, containing LvORF2, LvORF3, LvORF8, LvrolA, LvrolB, LvrolC, LvORF13, LvORF14, and the Lvmis genes. In 2015, cT-DNA was found in Ipomoea. Two types of T-DNA-like sequences were described within this genera, and their distribution varied among cultured hexaploid, tetraploid, and wild diploid forms. Thus, several independent T-DNA integration events occurred in the genomes of these three plant genera. We propose that the events of T-DNA insertion in the plant genome might have affected their evolution, resulting in the creation of new plant species.

However, it resulted in a remarkable increase in crop yield but drastically reduced soil fertility; increased the production cost, food prices, and carbon footprints; and depleted the fossil reserves with huge penalties to the environment and ecological sustainability. The groundwater, rivers, and oceans are loaded with N excess which is an environmental catastrophe. Nitrogen emissions (e.g., ammonia, nitrogen oxide, nitrous oxide) play an important role in global climate change and contribute to particulate matter and acid rain causing respiratory problems, cancers, and damage to forests and buildings. Therefore, the nitrogen-polluted planet Earth needs concerted global efforts to avoid the disaster. Improved agricultural N management focuses on the synchronization of crop N demand and N supply along with improving the N-use efficiency of the crops. However, there is very little focus on the natural sources of N available for plants in the form of diazotrophic bacteria present inside or on the root surface and the rhizosphere. These diazotrophs are the mini-nitrogen factories that convert available (78%) atmospheric N2 to ammonia through a process known as biological nitrogen fixation which is then taken up by the plants for its metabolic functioning. Diazotrophs also stimulate root architecture by producing plant hormones and hence improve the plant's overall ability to uptake nutrients and water. In recent years, nanotechnology has revolutionized the whole agri-industry by introducing nano-fertilizers and coated/slow-releasing fertilizers. With this in mind, we tried to explore the following questions: To what extent can the crop N requirements be met by diazotroph inoculation? Can N input to agriculture be managed in a way leading to environmental benefits and farmers saving money? Can nanotechnology help in technological advancement of diazotroph application? The review suggests that an integrated technology based on slow-releasing nano-fertilizer combined with diazotrophs should be adopted to decrease nitrogen inputs to the agricultural system.

Alternative technologies, such as cisgenesis and genome-editing may address many of such issues and facilitate the development of genetically engineered crop varieties with multiple favourable traits. Genetic engineering and plant transformation have played a pivotal role in crop improvement via introducing beneficial foreign gene(s) or silencing the expression of endogenous gene(s) in crop plants. Genetically modified crops possess one or more useful traits, such as, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, and nutritional improvement. To date, nearly 525 different transgenic events in 32 crops have been approved for cultivation in different parts of the world. The adoption of transgenic technology has been shown to increase crop yields, reduce pesticide and insecticide use, reduce CO2 emissions, and decrease the cost of crop production. However, widespread adoption of transgenic crops carrying foreign genes faces roadblocks due to concerns of potential toxicity and allergenicity to human beings, potential environmental risks, such as chances of gene flow, adverse effects on non-target organisms, evolution of resistance in weeds and insects etc. These concerns have prompted the adoption of alternative technologies like cisgenesis, intragenesis, and most recently, genome editing. Some of these alternative technologies can be utilized to develop crop plants that are free from any foreign gene hence, it is expected that such crops might achieve higher consumer acceptance as compared to the transgenic crops and would get faster regulatory approvals. In this review, we present a comprehensive update on the current status of the genetically modified (GM) crops under cultivation.

This study provides a systematic investigation of physical and chemical surface parameters that influence bacteria capture over lectin-functionalized polymer interfaces and then applies these findings to construct surfaces with significantly enhanced bacteria capture. The designer block copolymer poly(glycidyl methacrylate)- block-poly(vinyldimethyl azlactone) was used as a lectin attachment layer, and lectin coupling into the polymer film through azlactone-lectin coupling reactions was first characterized. Here, experimental parameters including polymer areal chain density, lectin molecular weight, and lectin coupling buffer were systematically varied to identify parameters driving highest azlactone conversions and corresponding lectin surface densities. To introduce physical nanostructures into the attachment layer, nanopillar arrays (NPAs) of varied heights (300 and 2100 nm) were then used to provide an underlying surface template for the functional polymer layer. Capture of Escherichia coli on lectin-polymer surfaces coated over both flat and NPA surfaces was then investigated. For flat polymer interfaces, bacteria were detected on the surface after incubation at a solution concentration of 103 cfu/mL, and a corresponding detection limit of 1.7 * 103 cfu/mL was quantified. This detection limit was 1 order of magnitude lower than control lectin surfaces functionalized with standard, carbodiimide coupling chemistry. NPA surfaces containing 300 nm tall pillars further improved the detection limit to 2.1 * 102 cfu/mL, but also reduced the viability of captured cells. Finally, to investigate the impact of cell surface parameters on capture, we used Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells genetically modified to allow manipulation of exopolysaccharide adhesin production levels. Statistical analysis of surface capture levels revealed that lectin surface density was the primary factor driving capture, as opposed to exopolysaccharide adhesin expression. These findings emphasize the critical importance of the synthetic interface and the development of surfaces that combine high lectin densities with tailored physical features to drive high levels of capture. These insights will aid in design of biofunctional interfaces with physicochemical surface properties favorable for capture and isolation of bacteria cells from solutions.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,1,0,0,4,0,9,NA,NA,,1526-4602,NA,MEDLINE:31150217,31150217,NA

In the present study, the E3 ubiquitin ligase gene AdBiL (Adi3 Binding E3 Ligase) was introduced into tomato line Ailsa Craig via Agrobacterium-mediated method. Transgenic lines were confirmed for integration into the tomato genome using PCR. Transcription of AdBiL in various transgenic lines was determined using real-time PCR. Evaluation of stress tolerance showed that T1 generation of transgenic tomato lines showed only mild symptoms of chilling injury as evident by higher biomass accumulation and chlorophyll content than those of non-transformed plants. Compared with wild-type plants, the contents of AsA, AsA/DHA, GSH and the activity of GaILDH, gamma-GCS and GSNOR were increased, while H2O2, [Formula: see text], MDA, NO, SNOs, and GSNO accumulations were significantly decreased in AdBiL overexpressing plants in response to chilling stress. Furthermore, transgenic tomato plants overexpressing AdBiL showed higher activities of enzymes such as G6PDH, 6PGDH, NADP-ICDH, and NADP-ME involved in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The transgenic tomato plants also exhibited an enhanced tolerance against the necrotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum.

In its simplest form, TCS-dependent regulation of transcription entails phosphoryl-transfer from a sensory histidine kinase to its cognate DNA-binding receiver protein. However, in certain cases, auxiliary proteins may modulate TCSs in response to secondary environmental cues. Caulobacter crescentus FixT is one such auxiliary regulator. FixT is composed of a single receiver domain and functions as a feedback inhibitor of the FixL-FixJ (FixLJ) TCS, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in adaptation to microaerobiosis. We sought to define the impact of fixT on Caulobacter cell physiology and to understand the molecular mechanism by which FixT represses FixLJ signaling. fixT deletion results in excess production of porphyrins and premature entry into stationary phase, demonstrating the importance of feedback inhibition of the FixLJ signaling system. Although FixT is a receiver domain, it does not affect dephosphorylation of the oxygen sensor kinase FixL or phosphoryl-transfer from FixL to its cognate receiver FixJ. Rather, FixT represses FixLJ signaling by inhibiting the FixL autophosphorylation reaction. We have further identified a 4-cysteine motif in Caulobacter FixT that binds an Fe-S cluster and protects the protein from degradation by the Lon protease. Our data support a model in which the oxidation of this Fe-S cluster promotes the degradation of FixT in vivo This proteolytic mechanism facilitates clearance of the FixT feedback inhibitor from the cell under normoxia and resets the FixLJ system for a future microaerobic signaling event.IMPORTANCE Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are broadly conserved in the bacterial kingdom and generally contain two molecular components, a sensor histidine kinase and a receiver protein. Sensor histidine kinases alter their phosphorylation state in direct response to a physical or chemical cue, whereas receiver proteins receive the phosphoryl group from the kinase to regulate a change in cell physiology. We have discovered that a single-domain receiver protein, FixT, binds an Fe-S cluster and controls Caulobacter heme homeostasis though its function as a negative-feedback regulator of the oxygen sensor kinase FixL. We provide evidence that the Fe-S cluster protects FixT from Lon-dependent proteolysis in the cell and endows FixT with the ability to function as a second, autonomous oxygen/redox sensor in the FixL-FixJ signaling pathway.

The recent focus on crop plant genomics-yet based on the Arabidopsis toolbox-boosted the research for more efficient plant transformation protocols, thereby considerably widened the number of genetically tractable crops. Moreover, modern genome editing methods such as the CRISPR/Cas technique are game changers in plant breeding, though heavily dependent on technical optimization of plant transformation. Basically, there are two successful ways of introducing DNA into plant cells: one is making use of a living DNA vector, namely, microbes such as the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens that infects plants and naturally transfers and subsequently integrates DNA into the plant genome. The other method uses a direct physical transfer of DNA by means of microinjection, microprojectile bombardment, or polymers such as polyethylene glycol. Both ways subsequently require sophisticated strategies for selecting and multiplying the transformed cells under tissue culture conditions to develop into a fully functional plant with the new desirable characteristics.

Here, we examined the functional involvement of ABA signaling components in pre- and post-invasive defense responses of Arabidopsis against the virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Overexpression of the ABA receptor, RCAR3, enhanced susceptibility to Pst DC3000 by suppressing callose deposition and induction of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, such as PR1 and NPR1, after syringe infiltration. In contrast, a dip inoculation assay revealed that RCAR3-overexpression mutants inhibited stomatal reopening during Pst DC3000 infection and coronatine (COR) treatment, leading to enhanced resistance to Pst DC3000, which was not accompanied by differential expression of PR1 and NPR1 genes. As a negative regulator of ABA signaling, PP2CA interacted with RCAR3 and its loss-of-function and overexpression mutants revealed that ABA sensitivity was positively correlated with stomatal immunity, similar to RCAR3 overexpression mutants.

The identification of host-Brucella interaction is crucial to understand host immunity against Brucella infection and Brucella pathogenesis against host immune responses.

Many text-mining systems for extracting gene and protein interactions have been proposed. However, only a few of them have been designed by considering the peculiarities of host-pathogen interactions. In this paper, we used a text mining approach for extracting host-Brucella gene-gene interactions from the abstracts of articles in PubMed. The gene-gene interactions here represent the interactions between genes and/or gene products (e.g., proteins). The SciMiner tool, originally designed for detecting mammalian gene/protein names in text, was extended to identify host and Brucella gene/protein names in the abstracts. Next, sentence-level and abstract-level co-occurrence based approaches, as well as sentence-level machine learning based methods, originally designed for extracting intra-species gene interactions, were utilized to extract the interactions among the identified host and Brucella genes. The extracted interactions were manually evaluated. A total of 46 host-Brucella gene interactions were identified and represented as an interaction network. Twenty four of these interactions were identified from sentence-level processing. Twenty two additional interactions were identified when abstract-level processing was performed. The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) was used to represent the identified interaction types at a hierarchical ontology structure.

Despite these advantages, the methods of genetic manipulation are poorly developed in D. officinale. In this study, based on the previously developed Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system, we identified several highly efficient promoters for exogenous gene expression and successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for editing endogenous genes in the genome of D. officinale.

The experiment had a completely randomized block design with the following treatments: control soil (C), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil-VA1), soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil-VA10), soil with C. freundii (Cit), soil with vancomycin (1 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA1+Cit), and soil with vancomycin (10 mg/kg soil) and C. freundii (VA10+Cit).

Although biocontrol has yielded some successes in managing aflatoxin contamination, enhancing crop resistance is still the preferred choice of management for long-term sustainability. Hence, host induced gene silencing (HIGS) strategy was explored in this study. The A. flavus gene aflM encoding versicolorin dehydrogenase, a key enzyme involved in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway, was selected as a possible target for suppression through HIGS. An RNAi vector containing a portion of the aflM gene was constructed and introduced into immature B104 maize zygotic embryos through Agrobacterium transformation. PCR analysis of the genomic DNA from T0 leaf tissue confirmed the presence of the transgene in six out of the seven events. The seeds from the lines that showed reduced aflatoxin production in laboratory aflatoxin kernel screening assay (KSA) have been increased from T1 to T4 generation in the past four years. Changes in aflatoxin resistance in these transgenic kernels have been evaluated under both field and laboratory conditions. The T2 generation kernels containing the transgene from two events out of four examined had less aflatoxin (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.08) than those without the transgene. Field-inoculated homozygous T3 and T4 transgenic kernels also revealed lower levels of aflatoxins (P ≤ 0.04) than kernels from the null (segregated non-transgenic samples) or B104 controls. A similar result was observed when the harvested T3 and T4 homozygous transgenic kernels were evaluated under KSA conditions without inoculation (P ≤ 0.003-0.05). These two events were crossed with LH195, LH197, LH210, and PHW79 elite breeding lines and the resulting crosses supported less aflatoxin (P ≤ 0.02) than the crosses made with non-transgenic lines. In addition, significantly higher levels of aflM gene-specific small RNAs were detected in the transgenic leaf and kernel tissues, indicating that the enhanced aflatoxin resistance in the homozygous transgenic kernels is likely due to suppression of aflM expression through HIGS.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,1,0,0,10,0,15,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:32411110,32411110,NA

The suppression of GhDAN1 mainly regulates genes with AAAG motifs in auxin-response pathways, which are associated with drought stress regulation. As a result, GhDAN1-silenced plants exhibit improved tolerance to drought stress. This phenotype resembles the drought-tolerant phenotype of the A-diploid cotton ancestor species, which has an undetectable expression of DAN1.

It is recognized that S.scabies regulates its pathogenicity via gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)-dependent quorum sensing (QS) signalling. AttM, from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 strain, has recently been proposed to have GBL-assimilative capacity. Here, we presented the introduction of A.tumefaciens-derived attM gene into S.scabies using the Escherichia coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pIJ8600 via intergeneric conjugation, followed by the investigation of secondary metabolism (mycelium growth, TXT production and pathogenicity) in S.scabies attM exconjugants (S.s/attM) in comparison with their wild-type parent strain (S.s/WT). Among the resultant S.s/attM exconjugants, attM was found to be integrated into S.scabies chromosome as analysed by Southern blotting. Moreover, S.s/attM failed to evoke the disease symptoms in planta and displayed altered morphological differentiation in contrast to S.s/WT. The abolishment of TXT production in S.s/attM substantiated the loss of pathogenicity and also implied that attM, when constitutively expressed in S.scabies, could paralyse its GBL signalling pathway. Altogether, lactonase-coding gene attM would be useful in a quorum quenching strategy for plant protection via suppressing TXT production and pathogenicity of S.scabies.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides an efficient means to introduce the lactonase gene attM from Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Streptomyces scabies for evaluating the role of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) in thaxtomin A production and pathogenicity, etc. Our results showed that pathogenicity was abrogated in attM-expressing S.scabies exconjugants.

A gene-splitting technique based on intein-mediated trans-splicing represents a new strategy for controlling transgene flow via biological measures. In this study, the G2-aroA gene which provides glyphosate tolerance was split into an N-terminal and a C-terminal region, which were then fused to intein N and intein C of the Ssp DnaE intein, ultimately forming EPSPSn:In and Ic:EPSPSc fusion genes, respectively. These fusion genes were subsequently transformed into the rice cultivar Zhonghua 11 via the Agrobacterium-mediated method. The two split gene fragments were then introduced into the same rice genome by genetic crossings. Glyphosate tolerance analysis revealed that the functional target protein was reconstituted by Ssp DnaE intein-mediated trans-splicing and that the resultant hybrid rice was glyphosate tolerant. The reassembly efficiency of the split gene fragments ranged from 67 to 91% at the molecular level, and 100% of the hybrid F1 progeny were glyphosate tolerant. Transgene flow experiments showed that when the split gene fragments are inserted into homologous chromosomes, the gene-splitting technique can completely avoid the escape of the target trait to the environment.

This work aimed to assess the effect of intein-mediated gene splitting on containment of transgene flow. Two fusion genes, EPSPSn-In and Ic-EPSPSc, were constructed and integrated into N. tabacum, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. EPSPSn-In encodes the first 295 aa of the herbicide resistance gene 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) fused with the first 123 aa of the Ssp DnaE intein (In), whereas Ic-EPSPSc encodes the 36 C-terminal aa of the Ssp DnaE intein (Ic) fused to the rest of EPSPS C terminus peptide sequences. Both EPSPSn-In and Ic-EPSPSc constructs were introduced into the same N. tabacum genome by genetic crossing. Hybrids displayed resistance to the herbicide N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine (glyphosate). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from hybrid plants identified full-length EPSPS. Furthermore, all hybrid seeds germinated and grew normally on glyphosate selective medium. The 6-8 leaf hybrid plants showed tolerance of 2000 ppm glyphosate in field spraying. These results indicated that functional EPSPS protein was reassembled in vivo by intein-mediated trans-splicing in 100% of plants. In order to evaluate the effect of the gene splitting technique for containment of transgene flow, backcrossing experiments were carried out between hybrids, in which the foreign genes EPSPSn-In and Ic-EPSPSc were inserted into different chromosomes, and non-transgenic plants NC89. Among the 2812 backcrossing progeny, about 25% (664 plantlets) displayed glyphosate resistance. These data indicated that transgene flow could be reduced by 75%.

Additionally, overexpressing GmUGT produced soybean varieties that were more sensitive to H. armigera and S. litura. Both mutant and overexpressing lines exhibited no obvious phenotypic changes.

It is considered one of the promising crops to overcome the challenges of poverty and hunger worldwide. However, it is exposed to different biotic and abiotic stresses that can cause significant losses in production. Thus, potato is a candidate of special relevance for improvements through conventional breeding and biotechnology. Since conventional breeding is time-consuming and challenging, genetic engineering provides the opportunity to introduce/switch-off genes of interest without altering the allelic combination that characterize successful commercial cultivars or to induce targeted sequence modifications by New Breeding Techniques. There is a variety of methods for potato improvement via genetic transformation. Most of them incorporate genes of interest into the nuclear genome; nevertheless, the development of plastid transformation protocols broadened the available approaches for potato breeding. Although all methods have their advantages and disadvantages, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most used approach. Alternative methods such as particle bombardment, protoplast transfection with polyethylene glycol and microinjection are also effective. Independently of the DNA delivery approach, critical steps for a successful transformation are a rapid and efficient regeneration protocol and a selection system. Several critical factors affect the transformation efficiency: vector type, insert size, Agrobacterium strain, explant type, composition of the subculture media, selective agent, among others. Moreover, transient or stable transformation, constitutive or inducible promoters, antibiotic/herbicide resistance or marker-free strategies can be considered. Although great efforts have been made to optimize all the parameters, potato transformation protocols are highly genotype-dependent. Genome editing technologies provide promising tools in genetic engineering allowing precise modification of targeted sequences. Interestingly, transient expression of genome editing components in potato protoplasts was reported to generate edited plants without the integration of any foreign DNA, which is a valuable aspect from both a scientific and a regulatory perspective. In this review, current challenges and opportunities concerning potato genetic engineering strategies developed to date are discussed.

Expression of ZmGA20ox also affected the expression of genes coding for key enzymes in lignin biosynthesis.

Forster resonance energy transfer combined with noninvasive fluorescence lifetime imaging analysis indicates that the interaction occurs in the barley nucleus. Transient expression and virus-induced gene silencing analyses indicate that WRKY3 acts as a repressor of disease resistance to the Bgh fungus. Barley plants overexpressing WRKY3 have enhanced fungal microcolony formation and sporulation. Phosphorylation assays show that SnRK1 phosphorylates WRKY3 mainly at Ser83 and Ser112 to destabilize the repressor, and WRKY3 non-phosphorylation-null mutants at these two sites are more stable than the wild-type protein. SnRK1-overexpressing barley plants display enhanced disease resistance to Bgh. Transient expression of SnRK1 reduces fungal haustorium formation in barley cells, which probably requires SnRK1 nuclear localization and kinase activity. Together, these findings suggest that SnRK1 is directly involved in plant immunity through phosphorylation and destabilization of the WRKY3 repressor, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of immune derepression in plants.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,1,0,0,7,0,11,NA,NA,,2590-3462,NA,MEDLINE:33367247,33367247,NA

The ability to make specific modifications to a plant's genetic material creates opportunities for rapid development of elite cultivars with desired traits. The plant genome can be altered in several ways, including targeted introduction of nucleotide changes, deleting DNA segments, introducing exogenous DNA fragments and epigenetic modifications. Targeted changes are mediated by sequence specific nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated protein) systems. Recent advances in engineering chimeric Cas nucleases fused to base editing enzymes permit for even greater precision in base editing and control over gene expression. In addition to gene editing technologies, improvement in delivery systems of exogenous DNA into plant cells have increased the rate of successful gene editing events. Regeneration of fertile plants containing the desired edits remains challenging; however, manipulation of embryogenesis-related genes such as BABY BOOM (BBM) has been shown to facilitate regeneration through tissue culture, often a major hurdle in recalcitrant cultivars. Epigenome reprogramming for improved crop performance is another possibility for future breeders, with recent studies on MutS HOMOLOG 1 (MSH1) demonstrating epigenetic-dependent hybrid vigor in several crops. While these technologies offer plant breeders new tools in creating high yielding, better adapted crop varieties, constantly evolving government policy regarding the cultivation of plants containing transgenes may impede the widespread adoption of some of these techniques.

They simulate in situ environmental conditions for the isolation of environmental microbiota through the exchange of growth substrates during cultivation. Here, we introduce leaf-based culture media adopting the concept of the plant being the master architect of the composition of its microbial community. Pre-physical treatments of sunflower plant leaves, namely punching, freezing, and/or autoclavation, allowed the diffusion of electrolytes and other nutrients to configure the leaf surface as a natural pad, i.e., creating an in situ similis environment suitable for the growth of rarely isolated microbiota. We used surface inoculation and membrane-filtration methods to assess the culturability of endophytic bacteria from the sunflower phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Both methods supported excellent colony-forming unit (CFU) development when compared to standard R2A medium, with a special affinity to support better growth of epiphytic and endophytic populations of the phyllosphere compared with the rhizosphere. A 16S rRNA gene analysis of >122 representative isolates indicated the cultivation of a diverse set of microorganisms by application of the new methods. It indicated the predominance of 13 genera of >30 potential species, belonging to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and especially genera not commonly reported for sunflower, e.g., Rhizobium, Aureimonas, Sphingomonas, Paracoccus, Stenotrophomonas, Pantoea, Kosakonia, and Erwinia. The strategy successfully extended diversity and richness in the endophyllosphere compared to the endorhizosphere, while CFUs grown on the standard R2A medium mainly pertain to Firmicutes, especially Bacillus spp. MALDI-TOF MS analysis clustered the isolates according to their niche and potential functions, where the majority of isolates of the endorhizosphere were clustered away from those of the endophyllosphere. Isolates identified as Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were distinguishably sub-clustered, which was in contrast to the heterogeneous isolates of Firmicutes (Bacillus spp.). In conclusion, leaf in situ similis cultivation is an effective strategy to support the future application of culturomics of plant microbiota. This is an effort to access novel isolates that are more adapted and competitive in their natural environments, especially those subjected to abiotic stresses like those prevailing in arid/semi-arid zones, and, consequently, to support the application of agro-biotechnologies, among other technologies, to improving agriculture in such zones.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,NA,NA,1664-302X,,NA,MEDLINE:32318031,32318031,NA

This study examined the roles of four ArsR proteins in the well-developed model Gram-negative bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. RNASeq was used to compare and characterize gene expression profiles in ± arsenite-treated cells of the wild-type strain and in four different arsR mutants. We report that ArsR-controlled transcription regulation is truly global, extending well beyond the current ars operon model, and includes both repression as well as apparent activation effects. Many cellular functions are significantly influenced, including arsenic resistance, phosphate acquisition/metabolism, sugar transport, chemotaxis, copper tolerance, iron homeostasis, and many others. While there is evidence of some regulatory overlap, each ArsR exhibits its own regulatory profile. Furthermore, evidence of a regulatory hierarchy was observed; i.e. ArsR1 represses arsR4, ArsR4 activates arsR2, and ArsR2 represses arsR3. Additionally and unexpectedly, aioB (arsenite oxidase small subunit) expression was shown to be under partial positive control by ArsR2 and ArsR4.

Vitamin A deficiency is a global health problem that can be alleviated by enriching provitamin A carotenoids in a range of food crops. Suitable plants for biofortification are those with high levels of the provitamin A biosynthetic precursor, lycopene, which is enzymatically converted by lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) to beta-carotene, a provitamin A carotenoid. Crops, such as citrus, naturally accumulate high levels of provitamin A and other health-promoting carotenoids. Such plants may have useful genes to expand the synthetic biology toolbox for producing a range of phenotypes, including both high provitamin A crops and crops with unique compositions of health-promoting carotenoids. To examine enzyme variants having different activity levels, we introduced two citrus LCYB alleles into tomato, a plant with fruit rich in lycopene. Overexpression in tomato of the stronger allele of the citrus chromoplast-specific lycopene beta-cyclase (CsLCYb2a) produced golden transgenic tomato fruits with 9.3-fold increased levels of beta-carotene at up to 1.5 mg/g dry weight. The use of the weaker allele, CsLCYb2b, also led to enhanced levels of beta-carotene but in the context of a more heterogeneous composition of carotenoids. From a synthetic biology standpoint, these allelic differences have value for producing cultivars with unique carotenoid profiles. Overexpression of the citrus LCYB genes was accompanied by increased expression of other genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes and increased size and number of chromoplasts needed to sequester the elevated levels of carotenoids in the transgenic tomato fruits. The overexpression of the citrus LCYB genes also led to a pleiotropic effect on profiles of phytohormones and primary metabolites. Our findings show that enzyme variants are essential synthetic biology parts needed to create a wider range of metabolic engineering products. In this case, strong and weak variants of LCYB proved useful in creating dietary sources to alleviate vitamin A deficiency or, alternatively, to create crops with a heterogeneous composition including provitamin A and healthful, nonprovitamin A carotenoids.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,NA,NA,,1520-5118,NA,MEDLINE:33073979,33073979,NA

A number of phage therapy phase I and II clinical trials have concluded, and shown phages don't present significant adverse safety concerns. These clinical trials used simple phage suspensions without any formulation and phage stability was of secondary concern. Phages have a limited stability in solution, and undergo a significant drop in phage titre during processing and storage which is unacceptable if phages are to become regulated pharmaceuticals, where stable dosage and well defined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are de rigueur. Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of phage therapy outcomes depend on the phage concentration (i.e. the dose) delivered at the site of infection, and their ability to target and kill bacteria, arresting bacterial growth and clearing the infection. In addition, in vitro and animal studies have shown the importance of using phage cocktails rather than single phage preparations to achieve better therapy outcomes. The in vivo reduction of phage concentration due to interactions with host antibodies or other clearance mechanisms may necessitate repeated dosing of phages, or sustained release approaches. Modelling of phage-bacterium population dynamics reinforces these points. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the effect of formulation on phage therapy outcomes, given the need for phage cocktails, where each phage within a cocktail may require significantly different formulation to retain a high enough infective dose. This review firstly looks at the clinical needs and challenges (informed through a review of key animal studies evaluating phage therapy) associated with treatment of acute and chronic infections and the drivers for phage encapsulation. An important driver for formulation and encapsulation is shelf life and storage of phage to ensure reproducible dosages. Other drivers include formulation of phage for encapsulation in micro- and nanoparticles for effective delivery, encapsulation in stimuli responsive systems for triggered controlled or sustained release at the targeted site of infection. Encapsulation of phage (e.g. in liposomes) may also be used to increase the circulation time of phage for treating systemic infections, for prophylactic treatment or to treat intracellular infections. We then proceed to document approaches used in the published literature on the formulation and stabilisation of phage for storage and encapsulation of bacteriophage in micro- and nanostructured materials using freeze drying (lyophilization), spray drying, in emulsions e.g. ointments, polymeric microparticles, nanoparticles and liposomes.

Close to half of homes in CR have one or more dogs, corresponding to 1.4 million canines, most of them in the Central Valley within or near the cities of San Jose, Heredia, and Alajuela. From 302 dog sera collected from this region, 19 were positive for Brucella canis antigens, and five had antibodies against smooth lipopolysaccharide, suggesting infections by both B. canis and other Brucella species. B. canis strains were isolated in the Central Valley from 26 kennel dogs and three pet dogs, all displaying clinical signs of canine brucellosis. We detected three recent introductions of different B. canis strains in kennels: two traced from Mexico and one from Panama. Multiple locus-variable number tandem repeats (MLVA-16) and whole-genome sequencing (WGSA) analyses showed that B. canis CR strains comprise three main lineages. The tree topologies obtained by WGSA and MLVA-16 just partially agreed, indicating that the latter analysis is not suitable for phylogenetic studies. The fatty acid methyl ester analysis resolved five different B. canis groups, showing less resolution power than the MLVA-16 and WGSA. Lactobacillic acid was absent in linages I and II but present in linage III, supporting the recent introductions of B. canis strains from Mexico. B. canis displaying putative functional cyclopropane synthase for the synthesis of lactobacillic acid are phylogenetically intertwined with B. canis with non-functional protein, indicating that mutations have occurred independently in the various lineages.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,NA,NA,,1873-2542,NA,MEDLINE:33965789,33965789,NA

Immunotherapy is a possible path to fight against such pathologies by inducing antibodies against alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), which could induce the clearance of its pathologic form. Looking to develop a new low-cost, effective vaccine against synucleinopathies; we have designed a chimeric plant-made antigen comprising the subunit B of the enterotoxin from enterotoxigenic E. coli and three B cell epitopes from alpha-Syn, which is named LTB-Syn. In the present study, LTB-Syn was produced in carrot cell lines as appropriate platform for the formulation of oral vaccines not requiring purification. The development of transgenic carrot cell lines took 8 months and the LTB-Syn yield reached 2.3mug/g dry biomass. The antigen encapsulated in lyophilized carrot cells was highly stable at room temperature over a six-month period and upon heating at 50°C for 2h. Moreover, LTB-Syn was able to prime immune responses that, in combination with parenteral boosting using an OVA-Syn conjugate, induced significant humoral resposes in mice. Thus the carrot-made oral LTB-Syn vaccine is a promising candidate that deserves further analyses to advance in its preclinical evaluation.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,1,0,0,6,0,7,NA,NA,,1873-4863,NA,MEDLINE:31843518,31843518,NA

These associations may be symbiotic or asymbiotic depending upon the genetic potential of the resident microbe and promiscuity of the host. Present study describes the potential of two Serratia spp. strains for promotion of plant growth in homologous as well as non-homologous hosts. The strains KPS-10 and KPS-14; native to potato rhizosphere belong to genus Serratia based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (accession no. LN831934 and LN831937 respectively) and contain multiple plant growth promoting properties along-with the production of quorum sensing acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules. Both Serratia spp. strains showed solubilization of inorganic tri-calcium phosphate while KPS-14 also exhibited phytase activity (1.98 10-10 kcat). KPS-10 showed higher P-solubilization activity (128.5 mug/mL), IAA production (8.84 mug/mL), antifungal activity and also showed the production of two organic acids i.e., gluconic acid and lactic acid. Both strains produced three common AHLs: C6-HSL, 3oxo-C10-HSL, 3oxo-C12-HSL while some strain-specific AHLs (3OH-C5-HSL, 3OH-C6-HSL, C10-HSL specific to KPS-10 and 3OH-C6-HSL, C8-HSL, 3oxo-C9-HSL, 3OH-C9-HSL specific to KPS-14). Strains showed roots and rhizosphere colonization of potato and other non-homologous hosts up to one month. In planta AHLs-detection confirmed a likely role of AHLs during seedling growth and development where both extracted AHLs or bacteria inoculated roots showed extensive root hair. A significant increase in root/shoot lengths, root/ shoot fresh weights, root/shoot dry weights was observed by inoculation in different hosts. PGP-characteristics along with the AHLs-production signify the potential of both strains as candidate for the development of bio-inoculum for potato crop in specific and other crops in general. This inoculum will not only reduce the input of chemical fertilizer to the environment but also improve soil quality and plant growth.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,0,0,0,7,0,8,NA,NA,,1618-0623,NA,MEDLINE:32540731,32540731,NA

The formation of GKPtNP was confirmed by ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The formed GKPtNP are well dispersed, homogeneous with a size of 2-4±0.50 nm, having a negative zeta potential (-46.1 mV) indicating good stability. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) was loaded onto the synthesised GKPtNP, which leads to the development of a new combination of nanomedicine (5FU-GKPtNP). The in vitro drug release studies of 5FU-GKPtNP in pH 7.4 showed a sustained release profile over a period of 120 min. Agrobacterium tumefaciens induced in vitro potato tumour bioassay was employed for screening the anti-tumour potentials of GKPtNP, 5FU, and 5FU-GKPtNP. The experimental results suggested a complete tumour inhibition by 5FU-GKPtNP at a lower concentration than the GKPtNP and 5FU. Furthermore, the mechanism of anti-tumour activity was assessed by their interactions with DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis and UV-spectroscopic analysis. The electrophoresis results revealed that the 5FU-GKPtNP totally diminishes DNA and the UV-spectroscopic analysis showed a hyperchromic effect with red shift indicating intercalation type of binding with DNA. Over all, the present study revealed that the combined exposure of the nanoformulation resulted in the enhanced anti-tumour effect.",,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,NA,NA,,1751-875X,NA,MEDLINE:31053691,31053691,NA
