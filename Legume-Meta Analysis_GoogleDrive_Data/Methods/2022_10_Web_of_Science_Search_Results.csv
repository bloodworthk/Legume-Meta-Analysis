In total, 361 isolates were obtained from Mimosa pudica and Mimosa diplotricha in 25 locations. A multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) including 16S rRNA, atpD, dnaK, glnA, gyrB, and recA identified the isolates into eight genospecies corresponding to Paraburkhleria mimosarum, Paraburkholderia phymatum, Paraburkholeria carbensis, Cupriavidus taiwanensis, Cupriavidus sp., Rhizobium altiplani, Rhizobium mesoamericanum, and Rhizobium etli. The majority of the isolates were Cupriavidus (62.6%), followed by Paraburkholderia (33.5%) and Rhizobium (2.9%). Cupriavidus strains were more predominant in nodules of M. diplotricha (76.2) than in M. pudica (59.9%), and the distribution of P. phymatum in those two plant species was reverse (3.4:18.2%). Four symbiotypes were defined among the isolates based upon the phylogeny of nodA-nifH genes, represented by P. mimosarum, P. phymatum-P. caribensis, Cupriavidus spp., and Rhizobium spp. The species affiliation and the symbiotype division among the isolates demonstrated the multiple origins of Mimosa rhizobia in China: most were similar to those found in the original centers of Mimosa plants, but Cupriavidus sp. might have a local origin. The unbalanced distribution of symbionts between the two Mimosa species might be related to the soil pH, organic matter and available nitrogen; Cupriavidus spp. generally dominated most of the soils colonized by Mimosa in this study, but it had a particular preference for neutral-alkaline soils with low fertility whereas. While Paraburkholderia spp. preferred more acidic and fertile soils. The Rhizobium spp. tended to prefer neutral-acidic soils with high fertility soils.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:33250864,33250864,

Ten bacterial isolates produced functional nodules on D. lignosus. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences identified one isolate as Bradyrhizobium sp., one isolate as Rhizobium sp. and eight isolates as Burkholderia sp. The Bradyrhizobium sp. and Rhizobium sp. 16S rRNA sequences were identical to those of strains previously isolated from crop plants and may have originated from inocula used on crops. Both 16S rRNA and DNA recombinase A (recA) gene sequences placed the eight Burkholderia isolates separate from previously described Burkholderia rhizobial species. However, the isolates showed a very close relationship to Burkholderia rhizobial strains isolated from South African plants with respect to their nitrogenase iron protein (nifH), N-acyltransferase nodulation protein A (nodA) and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase nodulation protein C (nodC) gene sequences. Gene sequences and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR and repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) banding patterns indicated that the eight Burkholderia isolates separated into five clones of one strain and three of another. One strain was tested and shown to produce functional nodules on a range of South African plants previously reported to be nodulated by Burkholderia tuberum STM678(T) which was isolated from the Cape Region. Thus, evidence is strong that the Burkholderia strains isolated here originated in South Africa and were somehow transported with the plants from their native habitat to NZ.

We assumed that the same regularity exists in intracontinental invasions and thus investigated whether the reproductive traits of Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius, perform better in the alien invasive range in Europe compared to its native range in the same continent. The aim of this research was to reveal the potential and realised fecundity of C. scoparius in its native and invasive ranges, as well as relationships with the size of pods, habitat type, and how these traits vary at the same site in different years. The results of this study were not able to unambiguously confirm our hypothesis that C. scoparius in the invasive range in Lithuania, specifically in the southern part of the Boreal biogeographical region, outperform plants in the native range with regard to the analysed reproductive traits. Potential fecundity of C. scoparius in the native range was significantly higher than in the invaded range; however, realised fecundity was not significantly different between the native and invasive ranges. The pod length was similar in both ranges, whereas the pod width was significantly greater in the invasive range than in the native range. The results suggest that the number of ovules per pod, number of matured seeds, and the size of pods are related with the type of habitat and local environmental conditions in the habitat. Although many studies on other species have confirmed higher fecundity and overall better performance of plants in the invasive range than in the native range on other continents, this rule probably cannot be applied for intracontinental invasive species occurring in relatively close geographical regions to their native ranges.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2223-7747,,,MEDLINE:36015460,36015460,

Using legume-rhizobium mutualistic interactions as an example, we discuss two pathways that can influence symbiotic associations in such situations: co-introduction of coevolved rhizobia; and utilization of, and adaptation to, resident rhizobia, hereafter referred to as 'ecological fitting'. Co-introduction and ecological fitting have distinct implications for successful legume invasions and their impacts. Under ecological fitting, initial impacts may be less severe and will accrue over longer periods as novel symbiotic associations and/or adaptations may require fine-tuning over time. Co-introduction will have more profound impacts that will accrue more rapidly as a result of positive feedbacks between densities of non-native rhizobia and their coevolved host plants, in turn enhancing competition between native and non-native rhizobia. Co-introduction can further impact invasion outcomes by the exchange of genetic material between native and non-native rhizobia, potentially resulting in decreased fitness of native legumes. A better understanding of the roles of these two pathways in the invasion dynamics of non-native legumes is much needed, and we highlight some of the exciting research avenues it presents.",,,,,,,,,30,0,1,0,31,0,32,,,,1469-8137,,MEDLINE:28771816,28771816,

It has not been until recently that these mutualisms-mycorrhizas and legume-rhizobia on one hand, and pollinators and seed dispersers on the other hand-have been found to influence each other, with potential ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here we review the mechanisms that may link these two-level mutualisms, mostly reported for native plant species, and make predictions about their relevance during alien plant invasions. We propose that alien plants establishing effective mutualisms with belowground microbes might improve their reproductive success through positive interactions between those mutualists and pollinators and seed dispersers. On the other hand, changes in the abundance and diversity of soil mutualists induced by invasion can also interfere with below-aboveground links for native plant species.

Significant differences in diversity were observed between plant compartments. Specifically, the rhizosphere harbored many more bacterial operational taxonomic units and showed higher alpha diversity than the leaf and root endospheres. The relative abundance profiles of the bacterial community composition differed substantially between the compartments and populations, especially at the phylum and family levels. However, the top five phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria) accounted for more than 90% of all the bacterial communities.

Within specific regions, the invasive status of these species varies. Our study examined whether a key mechanism in the life history of Acacia species, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, influences acacia invasiveness on a regional scale. To assess the extent to which species varying in invasiveness correspondingly differ with regard to the diversity of rhizobia they associate with, we grew seven Acacia species ranging in invasiveness in California in multiple soils from both their native (Australia) and introduced (California) ranges. In particular, the aim was to determine whether more invasive species formed symbioses with a wider diversity of rhizobial strains (i.e. are more promiscuous hosts). We measured and compared plant performance, including aboveground biomass, survival, and nodulation response, as well as rhizobial community composition and richness. Host promiscuity did not differ among invasiveness categories. Acacia species that varied in invasiveness differed in aboveground biomass for only one soil and did not differ in survival or nodulation within individual soils. In addition, acacias did not differ in rhizobial richness among invasiveness categories. However, nodulation differed between regions and was generally higher in the native than introduced range. Our results suggest that all Acacia species introduced to California are promiscuous hosts and that host promiscuity per se does not explain the observed differences in invasiveness within this region.

BP exhibited the strongest transcriptome shift both quantitatively and qualitatively, which mirrors its high competitiveness in the early steps of symbiosis and its ancient evolutionary history as a symbiont, while CT had a minimal response which correlates with its status as a younger symbiont (probably via acquisition of symbiotic genes from a Burkholderia ancestor) and RM had a typical response of Alphaproteobacterial rhizospheric bacteria. Interestingly, the upregulation of nodulation genes was the only common response among the three strains; the exception was an up-regulated gene encoding a putative fatty acid hydroxylase, which appears to be a novel symbiotic gene specific to Mimosa symbionts.CONCLUSION: The transcriptional response to root exudates was correlated to each strain nodulation competitiveness, with Burkholderia phymatum appearing as the best specialised symbiont of Mimosa pudica.",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,11,0,14,,,,1471-2164,,MEDLINE:29378510,29378510,

The hallmark of an efficient quorum sensing system relies on the tight specificity in the signal generated by each bacterium. Since AHL signal specificity is derived from the acyl-chain of the acyl-ACP (ACP = acyl carrier protein) substrate, AHL synthase enzymes must recognize and react with the native acyl-ACP with high catalytic efficiency while keeping reaction rates with non-native acyl-ACPs low. The mechanism of acyl-ACP substrate recognition in these enzymes, however, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated differences in catalytic efficiencies for shorter and longer chain acyl-ACP substrates reacting with an octanoyl-homoserine lactone synthase Burkholderia mallei BmaI1. With the exception of two-carbon shorter hexanoyl-ACP, the catalytic efficiencies of butyryl-ACP, decanoyl-ACP, and octanoyl-CoA reacting with BmaI1 decreased by greater than 20-fold compared to the native octanoyl-ACP substrate. Furthermore, we also noticed kinetic cooperativity when BmaI1 reacted with non-native acyl-donor substrates. Our kinetic data suggest that non-native acyl-ACP substrates are unable to form a stable and productive BmaI1·acyl-ACP·SAM ternary complex and are thus effectively discriminated by the enzyme.

Vachellia nilotica can establish in drought-prone environments, and is invasive in high rainfall areas. Leucaena leucocephala is an emerging invasive in South Africa and is ranked among the world's 100 most invasive alien species. Alien plants can invade native habitats through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and displace native vegetation. We investigated the effects of phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity on legume-microbe symbiosis, nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) growth costs of these two legumes in grassland soils. We used as inoculum and growth substrate soils collected from a long-term (>65 years) nutrient and lime-addition trial, the Veld Fertilizer Trial (VFT), located at Ukulinga Research Farm near Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. We used soils from three VFT treatments: soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year (+P), soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year with dolomitic lime (2250 kg ha-1) applied once every 5 years (P+L) and soils with no superphosphate and no dolomitic lime applications (Control). Seeds of V. nilotica and L. leucocephala were germinated and grown independently in these soils in green house conditions and harvested after 125 days for measurement of growth, legume-microbe symbiosis, N nutrition and C growth costs. Results showed that the two legumes had different growth adaptations. Vachellia nilotica grown in control soils and +P soils nodulated with various Burkholderia spp., while L. leucocephala did not nodulate in all soil treatments. Both legumes utilized for growth both atmospheric- and soil-derived N across all treatments thereby decreasing C growth costs. Vachellia nilotica grown in +P soils accumulated the most biomass and N nutrition. Leucaena leucocephala maximized specific N assimilation rates by investing in below-ground biomass accumulation in control soils.

Many invasive species exhibit a high demand for nitrogen (N). Hence, this work aimed to study the N cycle alterations promoted by M. minutiflora in a site of the campo rupestre, where the leguminous species Mimosa pogocephala was prevalent. The biome's soils exhibited a high natural N fertility and low C:N ratio. The main N source in this biome resulted from the biological N fixation performed by M. pogocephala associated with Burkholderia nodosa, as evidenced by the total leaf N content, leaf delta15N signature, nodule occupation and bacterial molecular identification analyses. The displacement of native species by molasses grass was associated with changes in the soil N forms, namely the nitrate increased as the ammonium decreased. The latter was the dominant N form in the native species plots, as observed in the soil analysis of total N, ammonium and nitrate contents. The dominant ammonium form was changed to the nitric form by the stimulation of ammonia-oxidising bacteria populations due to the invasive species. Therefore, the key mechanism behind the invasiveness of the exotic grass and the concomitant displacement of the native species may be associated with changes in the soil N chemical species.

Chromosomal genes exhibited significantly higher nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype diversity than sym plasmid loci. A single derived sym plasmid haplotype (A1) was found to predominate in four of the populations, and was shared by multiple housekeeping gene clades.

Choosing particular plant genotypes for domestication and subsequent cultivar selection can narrow the gene pools of crop plants to a degree that they are no longer able to benefit from microbial mutualists. Elevated mineral nutrient levels in cultivated soils also reduce the dependence of crops on nutritional support by mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia. Thus, current ways of crop production are predestined to compromise the propagation and function of microbial symbionts, limiting their long-term benefits for plant yield stability. The influence of mutualists on non-native plant establishment and spread, i.e. biological invasions, provides an unexplored analogue to contemporary crop production that accounts for mutualistic services from symbionts like rhizobia and mycorrhizae. The historical exposure of organisms to biotic interactions over evolutionary timescales, or so-called eco-evolutionary experience (EEE), has been used to explain the success of such invasions. In this paper, we stress that consideration of the EEE concept can shed light on how to overcome the loss of microbial mutualist functions following crop domestication and breeding. We propose specific experimental approaches to utilize the wild ancestors of crops to determine whether crop domestication compromised the benefits derived from root microbial symbioses or not.

We found that native and invasive legumes interact with distinct rhizobial lineages, most likely due to phylogenetic uniqueness of native and invasive host plants. Moreover, legume-rhizobium interaction networks are not nested, but significantly modular with high levels of specialization possibly as a result of legume-rhizobium co-evolution. Although network topology remained constant across the invasion gradient, composition of bacterial communities associated with native legumes changed dramatically as acacias increasingly dominated the landscape. In stark contrast to aboveground interaction networks (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal) we show that invasive legumes do not infiltrate existing native legume-rhizobium networks but rather form novel modules.

Using DNA from 348 wild pigs and sera from 320 individuals at 24 sites, we employed population genetic techniques to infer individual dispersal, and an Akaike information criterion framework to compare candidate logistic regression models that incorporated both dispersal and land cover composition. Our findings suggested that recent dispersal conferred higher odds of exposure to PrV, but not Brucella spp., among wild pigs throughout the Kissimmee Valley region. Odds of exposure also increased in association with agriculture and open canopy pine, prairie, and scrub habitats, likely because of highly localized resources within those land cover types. Because the effect of open canopy on PrV exposure reversed when agricultural cover was available, we suggest that small-scale resource distribution may be more important than overall resource abundance.

STM 6070 is a heavy metal-tolerant strain that is highly effective at fixing nitrogen with M. pudica. Here we have provided an updated taxonomy for STM 6070 and described salient features of the annotated genome, focusing on heavy metal resistance (HMR) loci and heavy metal efflux (HME) systems.RESULTS: The 6,771,773bp high-quality-draft genome consists of 107 scaffolds containing 6118 protein-coding genes. ANI values show that STM 6070 is a new species of Cupriavidus. The STM 6070 symbiotic region was syntenic with that of the M. pudica-nodulating Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG 19424T. In contrast to the nickel and zinc sensitivity of C. taiwanensis strains, STM 6070 grew at high Ni2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. The STM 6070 genome contains 55 genes, located in 12 clusters, that encode HMR structural proteins belonging to the RND, MFS, CHR, ARC3, CDF and P-ATPase protein superfamilies. These HMR molecular determinants are putatively involved in arsenic (ars), chromium (chr), cobalt-zinc-cadmium (czc), copper (cop, cup), nickel (nie and nre), and silver and/or copper (sil) resistance. Seven of these HMR clusters were common to symbiotic and non-symbiotic Cupriavidus species, while four clusters were specific to STM 6070, with three of these being associated with insertion sequences. Within the specific STM 6070 HMR clusters, three novel HME-RND systems (nieIC cep nieBA, czcC2B2A2, and hmxB zneAC zneR hmxS) were identified, which constitute new candidate genes for nickel and zinc resistance.CONCLUSIONS: STM 6070 belongs to a new Cupriavidus species, for which we have proposed the name Cupriavidus neocaledonicus sp. nov..

Individual symbiosis genes (e.g., nodC) of these rhizobia can be different within each genus and among distinct genera. Little information is available about the symbiotic structure of indigenous Rhizobium strains nodulating introduced bean plants or the emergence of a symbiotic ability to associate with bean plants in Bradyrhizobium and Ensifer strains. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 29 representative bean microsymbionts (21 Rhizobium, four Ensifer, and four Bradyrhizobium) and compared them with closely related reference strains to estimate the origins of symbiosis genes among these Chinese bean microsymbionts.RESULTS: Comparative genomics demonstrated horizontal gene transfer exclusively at the plasmid level, leading to expanded diversity of bean-nodulating Rhizobium strains. Analysis of vertically transferred genes uncovered 191 (out of the 2654) single-copy core genes with phylogenies strictly consistent with the taxonomic status of bacterial species, but none were found on symbiosis plasmids. A common symbiotic region was wholly conserved within the Rhizobium genus yet different from those of the other two genera. A single strain of Ensifer and two Bradyrhizobium strains shared similar gene content with soybean microsymbionts in both chromosomes and symbiotic regions.CONCLUSIONS: The 19 native bean Rhizobium microsymbionts were assigned to four defined species and six putative novel species. The symbiosis genes of R. phaseoli, R. sophoriradicis, and R. esperanzae strains that originated from Mexican bean-nodulating strains were possibly introduced alongside bean seeds. R. anhuiense strains displayed distinct host ranges, indicating transition into bean microsymbionts. Among the six putative novel species exclusive to China, horizontal transfer of symbiosis genes suggested symbiosis with other indigenous legumes and loss of originally symbiotic regions or non-symbionts before the introduction of common bean into China. Genome data for Ensifer and Bradyrhizobium strains indicated symbiotic compatibility between microsymbionts of common bean and other hosts such as soybean.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,,1471-2164,,MEDLINE:32106817,32106817,

This should provide defense against the cytosol-invasive Burkholderia and Shigella species by lysing the infected cell via pyroptosis. However, recent evidence has shown caspase-11 and gasdermin D activation can result in two different outcomes: pyroptosis and autophagy. Burkholderia cepacia complex has the ability invade the cytosol but is unable to inhibit caspase-11 and gasdermin D. Yet instead of activating pyroptosis during infection with these bacteria, the autophagy pathway is stimulated through caspases and gasdermin D. In contrast, Burkholderia thailandensis can invade the cytosol where caspasae-11 and gasdermin D is activated but the result is pyroptosis of the infected cell. In this review we propose a hypothetical model to explain why autophagy would be the solution to kill one type of Burkholderia species, but another Burkholderia species is killed by pyroptosis. For pathogens with high virulence, pyroptosis is the only solution to kill bacteria. This explains why some pathogens, such as Shigella have evolved methods to inhibit caspase-11 and gasdermin D as well as autophagy. We also discuss similar regulatory steps that affect caspase-1 that may permit the cell to forbear undergoing pyroptosis after caspase-1 activates in response to bacteria with partially effective virulence factors.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1664-3224,,MEDLINE:35422805,35422805,

In a second experiment, plants inoculated with rhizobia generally produced more biomass, had greater tolerance to interspecific competition, and had greater effects on competitor biomass than uninoculated plants. However, plant genotypes collected from the native range benefited more from rhizobia and were less tolerant of competition relative to genotypes collected from the introduced range.

Contact with infected feral swine poses spillover risks to domestic pigs as well as humans, companion animals, wildlife, and other livestock. Genetic factors influence the outcome of infectious diseases; therefore, genome wide association studies (GWAS) of differential immune responses among feral swine can provide an understanding of disease dynamics and inform management to prevent the spillover of brucellosis from feral swine to domestic pigs. We sought to identify loci associated with differential antibody responses among feral swine naturally infected with B. suis using a case-control GWAS. Tissue, serum, and genotype data (68,516 bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms) collected from 47 feral swine were analyzed in this study. The 47 feral swine were culture positive for Brucella spp. Of these 47, 16 were antibody positive (cases) whereas 31 were antibody negative (controls).

Numerous studies implicate factors ranging from environmental plasticity, competition for nutrient and space, and allelopathy in the success of invasive species in general. The Brazilian Pepper tree (BP) was introduced to the United States in the 1800s and has since become a category one invasive plant in Florida. It has aggressively spread to about 3000 km(2) of terrestrial surface, fueled in part by the prevalence of the hybrid genotypes and environmental perturbations. It displays some of the well-established invasive mechanisms but there is a serious dearth of knowledge on the plant-microbe-soil interactions and whether the rhizobiome plays any roles in the displacement of native flora and the range expansion of BP. Several control measures, including chemical, mechanical, and biological antagonism have been used with limited success while restoration of natives in soils from which BP was removed has proved problematic partly due to a poorly understood phenomenon described as the BP legacy effect. Emerging evidence suggests that allelopathy, selective recruitment of beneficial soil microbes, disruption of microbial community structure and alteration of nutrient cycling, exhibited by many other invasive plant species may also be involved in the case of BP. This brief review discusses the well-established BP invasion mechanisms and highlights the current understanding of the molecular, below-ground processes. It also points out the gaps in studies on the potential role of microbial interactions in the success of BP invasion. These hitherto poorly studied mechanisms could further explain the aggressive spread of BP and could potentially contribute significantly to effective control measures and enable appropriate strategies for restoring native plants. The review advocates for the use of cutting-edge techniques in advancing the plant microbiome science. Ultimately, comparing metagenomic analyses of the rhizobiome of invasive plants grown in native and non-native soils could lead to a better understanding of the microbial determinants of biotic resistance, potentially empowering environmental managers with some predictive power of future trends of plant invasion.",,,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,14,2,20,,,1664-462X,,,MEDLINE:27252726,27252726,

Members of the genus Ensifer are best known for their ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with forage legumes of three related genera, Medicago L., Melilotus Mill., and Trigonella L., which are members of the tribe Trifolieae. These legumes have a natural distribution extending from the Mediterranean Basin through western Asia, where there is an unsurpassed number of species belonging to these genera. Trigonella suavissima L. is unusual in that it is the only species in the tribe Trifolieae that is native to Australia. We compared the genetic diversity and taxonomic placement of rhizobia nodulating T. suavissima with those of members of an Ensifer reference collection. Our goal was to determine if the T. suavissima rhizobial strains, like their plant host, are naturally limited to the Australian continent. We used multilocus sequence analysis to estimate the genetic relatedness of 56 T. suavissima symbionts to 28 Ensifer reference strains. Sequence data were partitioned according to the replicons in which the loci are located. The results were used to construct replicon-specific phylogenetic trees. In both the chromosomal and chromid trees, the Australian strains formed a distinct clade within E. meliloti The strains also shared few alleles with Ensifer reference strains from other continents. Carbon source utilization assays revealed that the strains are also unusual in their ability to utilize 2-oxoglutarate as a sole carbon source. A strategy was outlined for locating similar strains elsewhere.IMPORTANCE In this study, we employed a biogeographical approach to investigate the origins of a symbiotic relationship between an Australian legume and its nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. The question of the ancestral origins of these symbionts is based on the observation that the legume host is not closely related to other native Australian legumes. Previous research has shown that the legume host Trigonella suavissima is instead closely related to legumes native to the Mediterranean Basin and western Asia, suggesting that it may have been introduced in Australia from those regions. This led to the question of whether its rhizobia may have been introduced as well. In this study, we were unable to find persuasive evidence supporting this hypothesis. Instead, our results suggest either that the T. suavissima rhizobia are native to Australia or that our methods for locating their close relatives elsewhere are inadequate. A strategy to investigate the latter alternative is proposed.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,,1098-5336,,MEDLINE:28283520,28283520,

However, degradation efficiency is often hampered by the poor adhesion behaviour of the introduced bacteria. The phenoxy acid herbicide 4-chloro-2-methyl-phenoxy-acetic acid (MCPA) is a widespread groundwater contaminant. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific surface characteristics of MCPA-degrading bacteria could be linked to their degrading capabilities in sand filters. Four MCPA degraders with different taxonomic affiliations and original habitats (Sphingomonas sp. PM2, Sphingomonas sp. ERG5, Burkholderia sp. TFD34, Cupriavidus sp. TFD38) were characterised with regard to their motility, cell surface hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, adhesion behaviour and ability to mineralise MCPA. Strains PM2 and ERG5 were non-motile and hydrophobic, whilst strains TFD34 and TFD38 were motile and less hydrophobic. All the strains except ERG5 showed low biofilm formation on polystyrene, although it was significantly higher on glass. PM2 was the most efficient MCPA degrader as it displayed no lag phase and reached >50% mineralisation at all concentrations (0.0016-25mgL-1). PM2 adhered significantly better to sand than the other strains. No link was found between motility, biofilm formation and the ability to adhere to sand. PM2 completely removed MCPA for 14days when inoculated in sand columns with a constant inlet of 1mgL-1 MCPA. These results demonstrate that besides the ability to degrade the contaminant, surface hydrophobicity and adherence abilities are significant parameters controlling sustained degradation in flow-through sand columns and must be considered when selecting bacteria for bioaugmentation.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,10,,,,1432-0614,,MEDLINE:27734123,27734123,

To understand variation at different spatial scales, from individual legumes in the fynbos (South Africa) to a global context, we analyzed chromosomal (16S rRNA, recA) and symbiosis (nifH, nodA, nodC) gene sequences. We showed that the global diversity of nodulation genes is generally grouped according to the South African papilionoid or South American mimosoid subfamilies, whereas chromosomal sequence data were unrelated to biogeography. While nodulation genes are structured on a continental scale, a geographic or host-specific distribution pattern was not detected in the fynbos region. In host range experiments, symbiotic promiscuity of Burkholderia tuberum STM678(T) and B phymatum STM815(T) was discovered in selected fynbos species. Finally, a greenhouse experiment was undertaken to assess the ability of mimosoid (Mimosa pudica) and papilionoid (Dipogon lignosus, Indigofera filifolia, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Podalyria calyptrata) species to nodulate in South African (fynbos) and Malawian (savanna) soils. While the Burkholderia-philous fynbos legumes (D lignosus, I filifolia, and P calyptrata) nodulated only in their native soils, the invasive neotropical species M pudica did not develop nodules in the African soils. The fynbos soil, notably rich in Burkholderia, seems to retain nodulation genes compatible with the local papilionoid legume flora but is incapable of nodulating mimosoid legumes that have their center of diversity in South America.IMPORTANCE: This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic assessment of root-nodulating Burkholderia and investigated biogeographic and host-related patterns of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis in the South African fynbos biome, as well as at global scales, including native species from the South American Caatinga and Cerrado biomes.

Selection on cooperation and standing genetic variation for mutualism traits may differ between a mutualism's invaded and native ranges, which could alter cooperation and coevolutionary dynamics. To test for such differences, we compare mutualism traits between invaded- and native-range host-symbiont genotype combinations of the weedy legume, Medicago polymorpha, and its nitrogen-fixing rhizobium symbiont, Ensifer medicae, which have coinvaded North America. We find that mutualism benefits for plants are indistinguishable between invaded- and native-range symbioses. However, rhizobia gain greater fitness from invaded-range mutualisms than from native-range mutualisms, and this enhancement of symbiont fecundity could increase the mutualism's spread by increasing symbiont availability during plant colonization. Furthermore, mutualism traits in invaded-range symbioses show lower genetic variance and a simpler partitioning of genetic variance between host and symbiont sources, compared to native-range symbioses. This suggests that biological invasion has reduced mutualists' potential to respond to coevolutionary selection. Additionally, rhizobia bearing a locus (hrrP) that can enhance symbiotic fitness have more exploitative phenotypes in invaded-range than in native-range symbioses.

One site was invaded by a grass (Microstegium vimineum), another by a shrub (Rhamnus davurica), and the third by a tree (Ailanthus altissima). The native vegetation from these sites was used as reference. 16S rRNA and ITS regions were sequenced to study root-zone bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, in invaded and non-invaded samples and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). Though root-zone microbial community structure initially differed across locations, plant invasion shifted communities in similar ways. Indicator species analysis revealed that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) closely related to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota increased in abundance due to plant invasions. The Hyphomonadaceae family in the Rhodobacterales order and ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospirae phylum showed greater relative abundance in the invaded root-zone soils. Hyphomicrobiaceae, another bacterial family within the phyla Proteobacteria increased as a result of plant invasion, but the effect associated most strongly with root-zones of M. vimineum and R. davurica.

In agreement with phylogenetic and functional analyses, greater turnover of ammonium and nitrate was associated with plant invasion.

This was achieved after solubilization by dodecylphosphocholine and purification in the presence of the detergent. NccX crystal structure did not match the model based on the extensively characterized periplasmic domain of its closest homologue CnrX. Instead, the periplasmic domains of NccX appeared collapsed against the hydrophobic transmembrane segments, leading to an aberrant topology incompatible with membrane insertion. This was explained by a detergent-induced redistribution of the hydrophobic interactions among the transmembrane helices and a pair of hydrophobic patches keeping the periplasmic domains together in the native dimer. Molecular dynamics simulations performed with the full-length protein or with the transmembrane segments were used along with in vivo homodimerization assays (TOXCAT) to evaluate the determinants of the interactions between NccX protomers. Taken as a whole, computational and experimental results are in agreement with the structural model of CnrX where a cradle-shaped periplasmic metal sensor domain is anchored into the inner membrane by two N-terminal helices. In addition, they show that the main determinant of NccX dimerization is the periplasmic soluble domain and that the interaction between transmembrane segments is highly dynamic.

This barrier to invasion may be overcome if an invader either forms novel mutualistic associations or finds and associates with familiar mutualists in the exotic range. Here, we ask (1) does the community of rhizobial mutualists associated with invasive legumes in their exotic range overlap with that of local native legumes and (2) can any differences be explained by fundamental incompatibilities with particular rhizobial genotypes? To address these questions, we first characterized the rhizobial communities naturally associating with three invasive and six native legumes growing in the San Francisco Bay Area. We then conducted a greenhouse experiment to test whether the invasive legume could nodulate with any of a broad array of rhizobia found in their exotic range. There was little overlap between the Bradyrhizobium communities associated with wild-grown invasive and native legumes, yet the invasive legumes could nodulate with a broad range of rhizobial strains under greenhouse conditions. These observations suggest that under field conditions in their exotic range, these invasive legumes are not currently associating with the mutualists of local native legumes, despite their potential to form such associations. However, the promiscuity with which these invading legumes can form mutualistic associations could be an important factor early in the invasion process if mutualist scarcity limits range expansion. Overall, the observation that invasive legumes have a community of rhizobia distinct from that of native legumes, despite their ability to associate with many rhizobial strains, challenges existing assumptions about how invading species obtain their mutualists. These results can therefore inform current and future efforts to prevent and remove invasive species.",,,,,,,,,14,0,1,0,13,0,16,,,2045-7758,,,MEDLINE:29075475,29075475,

Indeed, the most potent promoters may be overlooked if their activity causes a lethal overproduction of the reporter genes when screening for transcriptional activity of potential promoter sequences with the luxCDABE cassette. To overcome this limitation, a variation of the mini-CTX-lux plasmid has been designed which allows reduction of promoter activity via the addition of an adjacent fluoride riboswitch. The riboswitch adds a layer of regulation between the promoter and the reporter gene, allowing cloning of stronger promoters by weakening expression, while giving the potential to induce with fluoride to provide a good signal for weaker promoters, thus circumventing limitations associated with reporter toxicity. We noticed the riboswitch potential portability issues between species, suggesting caution when using riboswitches non-native to the species where it is being used. This study introduces a new molecular biology tool which will allow for the identification of previously unverifiable or uncharacterized potent promoters and also provides a cloning vector for translational fusion with luciferase in a plasmid compatible with many species such as from the genera Burkholderia and Pseudomonas.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1664-8021,,,MEDLINE:35126444,35126444,

Kanamycin resistance cassette (KanR) and a truncated sequence of the replication origin (Rep) are contributing factors to C. necator low electroporation transformation efficiency.

Previous studies revealed that bacteria contain many promiscuous enzymes causing a so-called 'underground metabolism', which can be important for the evolution of novel pathways.

Adaptive laboratory evolution experiments revealed that two non-native enzymes catalysing the last steps of the DXP-dependent PLP pathway and two genomic alterations are sufficient to allow growth of vitamin B6 auxotrophic bacteria as rapid as the wild type. Thus, the existence of an underground metabolism in B. subtilis facilitates the generation of a pathway for synthesis of PLP using parts of a non-native vitamin B6 pathway.

Activation of cell-autonomous autophagy mechanism eliminate intracellular pathogens in which p62 a cytosolic cargo protein is selectively degraded, and an accumulation of this marker occurs if autophagy is deficient. Recurrent, relapsed and reinfection of B. pseudomallei in melioidosis patients in endemic area indicative of lack of complete of clearance and persistence of the pathogen. Reasoning that abundance in the levels of p62 may provide an indication of the intracellular infection, we sought to examine whether increase in intracellular p62 and bacterial burden with Burkholderia infection are linked to autophagy deficiency.METHODS: In this study, we investigated cell culture and mouse models of disease to identify an association between autophagy biomarkers (p62/NBR1) accumulation and intracellular persistence of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei.RESULTS: We demonstrate, that elevated levels of intracellular p62/NBR1 correlated with bacterial persistence, while pre-treatment with a pharmacological inducer of autophagy, rapamycin, reduced both intracellular p62, and bacterial survival. Our results showed an elevated p62 levels (2-5 fold) in spleen and liver cells of Burkholderia-infected BALB/c mice, as well as in spleen cells of Burkholderia-infected C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that an increase in p62/NBR1 was due to an autophagy deficiency. Similar to p62, cytosolic LC3-I levels were also elevated, while the characteristic conversion to the autophagosome-associated membrane bound form LC3-II was low in spleens of the infected mice further supporting the conclusion that autophagy was deficient.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that an increase in intracellular p62/NBR1 may be a potential host cell biomarker of B. mallei or B. pseudomallei infections, and identifying autophagy manipulation may potentially aid to therapeutic approach for complete clearance of the pathogen.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,7,0,9,,,,2050-4527,,MEDLINE:30569531,30569531,

Here, we investigated the taxonomic status of 12 South African root-nodulating Burkholderia isolates from native papilionoid legumes (Hypocalyptus coluteoides, H. oxalidifolius, H. sophoroides and Virgilia oroboides). Analysis of four gene regions (16S rRNA, recA, atpD and rpoB) revealed that the isolates represent a genealogically unique and exclusive assemblage within the genus.

Y4 inoculation, the yellow membrane was formed on the root surface of rice seedlings, and the Cd2+ flux rate in the elongation zone of T705 and X24 roots decreased by 36.0% and 35.0% in 3-day-old seedlings, as well as by 44.6% and 24.9% in 10-day-old seedlings, respectively. In conclusion, Burkholderia sp. Y4 inoculation inhibited the toxic effects of Cd on rice seedling growth through alleviating oxidative stress and damage caused by Cd. Furthermore, the root application of Burkholderia sp. Y4 effectively decreased the Cd2+ flux rate in the elongation zone of roots to inhibit the Cd uptake and accumulation in roots and shoots of rice seedlings. This study provides theoretical basis and data support for the application of Burkholderia sp.

The products of this specialized secretion system are particularly important for the B. pseudomallei infection. Lacking in one or more components of the TTSS demonstrated different degrees of defects in the intracellular lifecycle of B. pseudomallei. Further understanding the functional roles of proteins involved in B. pseudomallei TTSS will enable us to dissect the enigma of B. pseudomallei-host cell interaction. In this study, BipC (a translocator), which was previously reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei, was further characterized using the bioinformatics and molecular approaches. The bipCgene, coding for a putative invasive protein, was first PCR amplified from B. pseudomallei K96243 genomic DNA and cloned into an expression vector for overexpression in Escherichia coli. The soluble protein was subsequently purified and assayed for actin polymerization and depolymerization. BipC was verified to subvert the host actin dynamics as demonstrated by the capability to polymerize actin in vitro. Homology modeling was also attempted to predict the structure of BipC.

Infection occurs in humans and animals, typically through direct exposure to soil or water containing the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Case clusters of melioidosis have been described in humans following severe weather events and in exotic animals imported into melioidosis endemic zones. Direct transmission of B. pseudomallei between animals and/or humans has been documented but is considered extremely rare. Between March 2015 and October 2016 eight fatal cases of melioidosis were reported in slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) on display at a Wildlife Park in Northern Australia. To further investigate the melioidosis case cluster we sampled the meerkat enclosure and adjacent park areas and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all culture-positive B. pseudomallei environmental and clinical isolates.RESULTS: WGS confirmed that the fatalities were caused by two different B. pseudomallei sequence types (STs) but that seven of the meerkat isolates were highly similar on the whole-genome level. Used concurrently with detailed pathology data, our results demonstrate that the seven cases originated from a single original source, but routes of infection varied amongst meerkats belonging to the clonal outbreak cluster. Moreover, in some instances direct transmission may have transpired through wounds inflicted while fighting.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study supports the use of high-resolution WGS to enhance epidemiological investigations into transmission modalities and pathogenesis of melioidosis, especially in the instance of a possible clonal outbreak scenario in exotic zoological collections.

Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacteria, currently consisting of 23 closely related species, and Burkholderia gladioli, can cause serious and difficult-to-treat infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Identifying Burkholderia bacteria to the species level is considered important for understanding epidemiology and infection control, and predicting clinical outcomes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF) is a rapid method recently introduced in clinical laboratories for bacterial species-level identification. However, reports on the ability of MALDI-TOF to accurately identify Bcc to the species level are mixed.Aim. The aim of this project was to evaluate the accuracy of MALDI-TOF using the Biotyper and VITEK MS systems in identifying isolates from 22 different Bcc species and B. gladioli compared to recA gene sequencing, which is considered the current gold standard for Bcc.Methodology. To capture maximum intra-species variation, phylogenetic trees were constructed from concatenated multi-locus sequence typing alleles and clustered with a novel k-medoids approach. One hundred isolates representing 22 Bcc species, plus B. gladioli, were assessed for bacterial identifications using the two MALDI-TOF systems.Results.

In this study, short-term pre-exposure to silver ion (Ag+) was demonstrated to be a practical, economic, and green method to enhance the perdurability of azo dyes decoloration by WRF Phanerochaete chrysosporium under non-sterile conditions. In control (without Ag+ pre-exposure), decoloration deactivated since cycle 7 (<10%), whereas in Ag+ pre-exposure groups, the decoloration ratios remained 91.5%-94.7% after 7cycles. Variations in decoloration-related extracellular lignin enzyme activities were consistent with the decoloration effectiveness. The enhanced decoloration capability in Ag+ pre-exposure groups under non-sterile conditions could be ascribed to the selectively antimicrobial action by Ag+. The released Ag+ from the self-assembled silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could selectively stimulate the proliferation and viability of P. chrysosporium, and simultaneously inhibit the growths of invasive microorganisms. The pyrosequencing results indicated that genus Sphingomonas (24.1%-31.3%) was the main invasive bacteria in Ag+ pre-exposure groups after long-term operation owing to the AgNPs passivation. As control, the invasive fungi (Asterotremella humicola) and bacteria (Burkholderia spp.) occurred in control after short-term operation, and genus Burkholderia (74.9%) dominated after long-term operation, leading to decoloration deactivation.

However, only limited studies have focused on the gut microbiota of freshwater snails. Pomacea canaliculata is considered one of the worst invasive alien species in the world. Elucidating the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the gut of P. canaliculata snails may be helpful for better understanding the widespread invasion of this snail species. In this study, the buccal masses, stomachs, and intestines were isolated from seven P. canaliculata snails. The diversity and composition of the microbiota in the three gut sections were then investigated based on high-throughput Illumina sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene.RESULTS: The diversity of the microbiota was highest in the intestine but lowest in the buccal mass. A total of 29 phyla and 111 genera of bacteria were identified in all of the samples. In general, Ochrobactrum, a genus of putative cellulose-degrading bacteria, was the most abundant (overall relative abundance: 13.6%), followed by Sediminibacterium (9.7%), Desulfovibrio (7.8%), an unclassified genus in the family Aeromonadaceae (5.4%), and Cloacibacterium (5.4%).

To gain organic mercury resistance in CH34, broad-spectrum mer genes were introduced in a previous work via conjugation of the IncP-1beta plasmid pTP6. However, we recently noted that this CH34-derived strain, MSR33, unexpectedly showed an increased resistance to other metals (i.e., Co2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+). To thoroughly investigate this phenomenon, we resequenced the entire genome of MSR33 and compared its DNA sequence and basal gene expression profile to those of its parental strain CH34. Genome comparison identified 11 insertions or deletions (INDELs) and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whereas transcriptomic analysis displayed 107 differentially expressed genes. Sequence data implicated the transposition of IS1088 in higher Co2+ and Ni2+ resistances and altered gene expression, although the precise mechanisms of the augmented Cd2+ resistance in MSR33 remains elusive.

Finally, a recombinant strain Reh01 (p2M-pj-v) was constructed by heterologous expression of vgb and ldh knockout in C. necator H16. Compared with the control (Reh (p2)) under oxygen-limiting conditions (3%, v/v), the dry cell weight (DCW), PHB content, and PHB production of Reh01 (p2M-pj-v) increased by 31.0%, 30.9%, and 71.5%, respectively.

While investigating the genomic diversity of B. dolosa strains collected from an outbreak among CF patients, we previously identified fixL as a gene showing signs of strong positive selection. This gene has homology to fixL of the rhizobial FixL/FixJ two-component system. The goals of this study were to determine the functions of FixLJ and their role in virulence in B. dolosa. We generated a fixLJ deletion mutant and complemented controls in B. dolosa strain AU0158. Using a fixK-lacZ reporter we found that FixLJ was activated in low oxygen in multiple BCC species. In a murine pneumonia model, the B. dolosa fixLJ deletion mutant was cleared faster from the lungs and spleen than wild-type B. dolosa strain AU0158 at 7 days post infection. Interestingly, the fixLJ deletion mutant made more biofilm, albeit with altered structure, but was less motile than strain AU0158. Using RNA-seq with in vitro grown bacteria, we found ~11% of the genome was differentially expressed in the fixLJ deletion mutant relative to strain AU0158. Multiple flagella-associated genes were down-regulated in the fixLJ deletion mutant, so we also evaluated virulence of a fliC deletion mutant, which lacks a flagellum. We saw no difference in the ability of the fliC deletion mutant to persist in the murine model relative to strain AU0158, suggesting factors other than flagella caused the phenotype of decreased persistence. We found the fixLJ deletion mutant to be less invasive in human lung epithelial and macrophage-like cells.

Transcriptomic- and proteomic-based methodologies have been used to investigate mechanisms of virulence employed by B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis, a convenient surrogate; however, analysis of the pathogen and host metabolomes during infection is lacking. Changes in the metabolites produced can be a result of altered gene expression and/or post-transcriptional processes. Thus, metabolomics complements transcriptomics and proteomics by providing a chemical readout of a biological phenotype, which serves as a snapshot of an organism's physiological state. However, the poor signal from bacterial metabolites in the context of infection poses a challenge in their detection and robust annotation. In this study, we coupled mammalian cell culture-based metabolomics with feature-based molecular networking of mono- and co-cultures to annotate the pathogen's secondary metabolome during infection of mammalian cells. These methods enabled us to identify several key secondary metabolites produced by B. thailandensis during infection of airway epithelial and macrophage cell lines. Additionally, the use of in silico approaches provided insights into shifts in host biochemical pathways relevant to defense against infection. Using chemical class enrichment analysis, for example, we identified changes in a number of host-derived compounds including immune lipids such as prostaglandins, which were detected exclusively upon pathogen challenge. Taken together, our findings indicate that co-culture of B. thailandensis with mammalian cells alters the metabolome of both pathogen and host and provides a new dimension of information for in-depth analysis of the host-pathogen interactions underlying Burkholderia infection.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2373-8227,,MEDLINE:35767828,35767828,

Intensive training was started for all nursing staff involved in patient care. Cultures were sent from the environment (surfaces, water, air), intravenous fluids, disinfectants and antiseptics and opened/unopened medication.RESULTS: A total of 13 patients with cancer with tunneled catheters were affected with BCC BSI. The isolates were of similar antimicrobial sensitivity. No significant breach of infection control protocols could be identified. Cultures from the prepared intravenous medication bags grew BCC. Subsequently, culture from unused vials of the antiemetic granisetron grew BCC, whereas those from the unopened IV fluid bag and chemotherapy medication were negative.

We recently used yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening to identify a small set of novel Burkholderia proteins that were shown to attenuate disease progression in an aerosol infection animal model using the virulent Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 strain. Here, we performed an extended analysis of primarily nine B. mallei virulence factors and their interactions with human proteins to map out how the bacteria can influence and alter host processes and pathways. Specifically, we employed topological analyses to assess the connectivity patterns of targeted host proteins, identify modules of pathogen-interacting host proteins linked to processes promoting infectivity, and evaluate the effect of crosstalk among the identified host protein modules. Overall, our analysis showed that the targeted host proteins generally had a large number of interacting partners and interacted with other host proteins that were also targeted by B. mallei proteins. We also introduced a novel Host-Pathogen Interaction Alignment (HPIA) algorithm and used it to explore similarities between host-pathogen interactions of B. mallei, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica. We inferred putative roles of B. mallei proteins based on the roles of their aligned Y. pestis and S. enterica partners and showed that up to 73% of the predicted roles matched existing annotations. A key insight into Burkholderia pathogenicity derived from these analyses of Y2H host-pathogen interactions is the identification of eukaryotic-specific targeted cellular mechanisms, including the ubiquitination degradation system and the use of the focal adhesion pathway as a fulcrum for transmitting mechanical forces and regulatory signals.

All Bcc isolates were analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The prevalences of epidemic strain ST32 and of other Bcc strains were calculated. Ninety out of 227 CF patients were infected with Bcc during the study period. The prevalence of ST32 cases significantly decreased from 46.5% in 2000-2001 to 10.4% in 2014-2015 (P<0.001) due to occurrence of only one new case in 2003, as well as to the death of 72% of ST32-infected patients. Conversely, there was a significant increase in prevalence of other Bcc strains, which rose from 0 to 14.9% (P=0.015) and of transient infections. A micro-epidemic of infection with ST630 strain was observed in 2014 in lung transplant patients hospitalized in intensive care unit. The prevalence of epidemic strain ST32 decreased, whereas that of non-clonal strains of Bcc increased. Routine use of MLST allowed early detection of new and potentially epidemic strains.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,,1874-9356,,MEDLINE:28364392,28364392,

Three pairs of primers were used to find the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) synthase class and sequence. The synthesized polymers were composed by short-chain length PHA (scl-PHA), especially polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and medium chain length PHA (mcl-PHA), especially polyhydroxydodecanoate (PHDd), and their concentration, constitution and molecular weight depend on carbon source used.

Bioassays conducted in a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii demonstrated that W. auropunctata were preferentially attracted to the (S)-enantiomers of both alkyl pyrazines over the racemic mixtures in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of differential attraction of ants to the enantiomers of chiral pyrazine pheromones despite many examples of these compounds in the literature. In addition, using a chiral column it was determined that (S)-2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and (S)-3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine are the only enantiomers produced by W. auropunctata.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,1573-1561,,MEDLINE:25370918,25370918,

The global burden and distribution of melioidosis is poorly understood, including in the Caribbean. B. pseudomallei was previously isolated from humans and soil in eastern Puerto Rico but the abundance and distribution of B. pseudomallei in Puerto Rico as a whole has not been thoroughly investigated.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected 600 environmental samples (500 soil and 100 water) from 60 sites around Puerto Rico. We identified B. pseudomallei by isolating it via culturing and/or using PCR to detect its DNA within complex DNA extracts. Only three adjacent soil samples from one site were positive for B. pseudomallei with PCR; we obtained 55 isolates from two of these samples. The 55 B. pseudomallei isolates exhibited fine-scale variation in the core genome and contained four novel genomic islands. Phylogenetic analyses grouped Puerto Rico B. pseudomallei isolates into a monophyletic clade containing other Caribbean isolates, which was nested inside a larger clade containing all isolates from Central/South America. Other Burkholderia species were commonly observed in Puerto Rico; we cultured 129 isolates from multiple soil and water samples collected at numerous sites around Puerto Rico, including representatives of B. anthina, B. cenocepacia, B. cepacia, B. contaminans, B. glumae, B. seminalis, B. stagnalis, B. ubonensis, and several unidentified novel Burkholderia spp.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: B. pseudomallei was only detected in three soil samples collected at one site in north central Puerto Rico with only two of those samples yielding isolates. All previous human and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates were obtained from eastern Puerto Rico. These findings suggest B. pseudomallei is ecologically established and widely dispersed in the environment in Puerto Rico but rare. Phylogeographic patterns suggest the source of B. pseudomallei populations in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the Caribbean may have been Central or South America.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,15,0,16,,,,1935-2735,,MEDLINE:31487287,31487287,

They can code for many functions and may augment a bacterium's adaptation to its host or environment. GIs have been identified in strain J2315 of Burkholderia cenocepacia, whereas in strain AU 1054 there has been no published works on such regions according to our text mining and keyword search in Medline.RESULTS: In this study, we identified 21 GIs in AU 1054 by combining two computational tools. Feature analyses suggested that the predictions are highly reliable and hence illustrated the advantage of joint predictions by two independent methods. Based on putative virulence factors, four GIs were further identified as pathogenicity islands (PAIs). Through experiments of gene deletion mutants in live bacteria, two putative PAIs were confirmed, and the virulence factors involved were identified as lipA and copR. The importance of the genes lipA (from PAI 1) and copR (from PAI 2) for bacterial invasion and replication indicates that they are required for the invasive properties of B. cenocepacia and may function as virulence determinants for bacterial pathogenesis and host infection.CONCLUSIONS: This approach of in silico prediction of GIs and subsequent identification of potential virulence factors in the putative island regions with final validation using wet experiments could be used as an effective strategy to rapidly discover novel virulence factors in other bacterial species and strains.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,,1471-2180,,MEDLINE:28347342,28347342,

Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, in endemic areas, poses a challenge for treating the diseased populations without accurate diagnosis, and the disease-specific biomarkers linked with the infection have yet to be reported. Due to the invasive nature of the causative agent, Burkholderia pseudomallei, host innate effector mechanisms, including autophagy are known to be activated, resulting in differential expression of cellular proteins and immune markers. Identification of a disease-specific biomarker associated with B. pseudomallei infection will be helpful to facilitate rapid confirmation of melioidosis, which would enable early treatment and therapeutic success.Aim. We aimed to assess the levels of a host autophagy component, p62/NBR1, which function as a cargo-receptor in the process of autophagy activation leading to the degradation of ubiquitin-coated intracellular bacteria in which p62/NBR1 itself is degraded in the clearance of the pathogen. We further probed the extent of intracellular p62/NBR1 degradation and assessed its potential as a melioidosis biomarker.Methodology. We analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates using an ELISA-based assay for detecting cytosolic autophagy-related proteins p62/NBR1. We measured p62/NBR1 levels in diseased (confirmed B. pseudomallei infection) and non -diseased populations and utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and max Youden index analysis for evaluating potential disease biomarker characteristics.Results. Our results revealed a three to fivefold increase in p62/NBR1 levels confirmed melioidosis cases compared to uninfected healthy donors. Comparable to p62/NBR1, levels of cytosolic LC3-I levels also increased, whereas the levels of degraded membrane bound form LC3-II was low, suggesting autophagy deficiency. Proinflammatory serum cytokine response, particularly IL-6, was consistently higher alongside B. pseudomallei infection in comparison to healthy controls.Conclusions. ROC curve and max Youden index analysis suggest that increased p62/NBR1 levels in diseased populations display characteristics of a potential disease biomarker in melioidosis and illustrates that an elevated p62/NBR1 level, in conjunction with B. pseudomallei infection associated with autophagy deficiency.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,1473-5644,,MEDLINE:32815800,32815800,

However, the mechanisms for nitrate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) and As(III) remain unclear. In this study, we isolated two bacterial strains from arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, Ensifer sp. ST2 and Paracoccus sp. QY30. Both strains were capable of anaerobic As(III) oxidation, but only QY30 could oxidize Fe(II) under nitrate-reducing conditions. Both strains contain the As(III) oxidase gene aioA, whose expression was induced greatly by As(III) exposure. Both strains contain the whole suite of genes for complete denitrification, but the nitrite reductase gene nirK was not expressed in QY30 and nitrite accumulated under nitrate-reducing conditions. When the functional nirK gene was knocked out in strain ST2, its nitrite reduction ability was completely abolished and nitrite accumulated in the medium. Moreover, the ST2DeltanirK mutant gained the ability to oxidize Fe(II). When nirK gene from ST2 was introduced to QY30, the recombinant strain QY30::nirK gained the ability to reduce nitrite but lost the ability to oxidize Fe(II). These genetic manipulations did not affect the ability of both strains to oxidize As(III). Our results indicate that nitrite accumulation is required for anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) but not for As(III) oxidation in these strains. The results suggest that anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation in the two bacterial strains is primarily driven by abiotic reaction of Fe(II) with nitrite, while reduction of nitrate to nitrite is sufficient for redox coupling with anaerobic As(III) oxidation catalyzed by Aio.

We planted eight plant species (i.e., Acacia acuminata, A.microbotrya, Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. loxophleba, E.astringens, Calothamnus quadrifidus, Callistemon phoeniceus, Hakea lissocarpha and H.prostrata) in microcosms of field-conditioned soil with and without addition of AMF and rhizobia in a fully factorial experimental design.

We measured shoot and root biomass of native plants and Bromus, and on roots, the percentage colonization by AMF, number of rhizobia-forming nodules and number of proteaceous root clusters. We found no effect of plant root symbionts or Bromus addition on performance of myrtaceous, and as predicted, proteaceous species as they rely little or not at all on AMF and rhizobia. Soil treatments with AMF and rhizobia had a strong positive effect (i.e., larger biomass) on native legumes (A.microbotrya and A.acuminata). However, the beneficial effect of root symbionts on legumes became negative (i.e., lower biomass and less nodules) if Bromus was present, especially for one legume, i.e., A.acuminata, suggesting a disruptive effect of the invader on the mutualism. We also found a stimulating effect of Bromus on root nodule production in A.microbotrya and AMF colonization in A.acuminata which could be indicative of legumes' increased resource acquisition requirement, i.e., for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, in response to the Bromus addition.

We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the Bp1651 genome and analyzed the sequence using comparative genomic analyses with susceptible strains, keyword searches of the annotation, publicly available antimicrobial resistance prediction tools, and published reports. More than 100 genes in the Bp1651 sequence were identified as potentially contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Most notably, we identified three previously uncharacterized point mutations in penA, which codes for a class A beta-lactamase and was previously implicated in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The mutations result in amino acid changes T147A, D240G, and V261I. When individually introduced into select agent-excluded B. pseudomallei strain Bp82, D240G was found to contribute to ceftazidime resistance and T147A contributed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and imipenem resistance. This study provides the first evidence that mutations in penA may alter susceptibility to carbapenems in B. pseudomallei Another mutation of interest was a point mutation affecting the dihydrofolate reductase gene folA, which likely explains the trimethoprim resistance of this strain. Bp1651 was susceptible to aminoglycosides likely because of a frameshift in the amrB gene, the transporter subunit of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump.

Like other clinically important Gram-negative bacteria, fundamental to B. pseudomallei pathogenesis is the Bsa Type III Secretion System. The Bsa system injects bacterial effector proteins into the cytoplasm of target host cells subverting cellular pathways for the benefit of the bacteria. It is required for invasion of non-phagocytic host cells, escape from the endocytic compartment into the host cell cytoplasm, and for virulence in murine models of melioidosis. We have recently described the repertoire of effector proteins secreted by the B. pseudomallei Bsa system, however the functions of many of these effector proteins remain an enigma. One such protein is BipC, a homolog of the translocator/effector proteins SipC and IpaC from Salmonella spp. and Shigella flexneri respectively. SipC and IpaC each have separate and distinct roles acting both as translocators, involved in creating a pore in the eukaryotic cell membrane through which effector proteins can transit, and as effectors by interacting with and polymerizing host cell actin. In this study, pull-down assays demonstrate an interaction between BipC and actin. Furthermore, we show that BipC directly interacts with actin, preferentially with actin polymers (F-actin) and has the ability to polymerize actin in a similar manner as that described for SipC. Yet unlike SipC, BipC does not stabilize F-actin filaments, indicating a functionally distinct interaction with actin. Expression of Myc-tagged BipC in HeLa cells induces the formation of pseudopodia similar to that seen for IpaC. This study explores the effector function of BipC and reveals that actin interaction is conserved within the BipC/SipC/IpaC family of translocator/effector proteins.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,2235-2988,,MEDLINE:28770177,28770177,

A case-control study was conducted to enroll 53 CCA patients, 47 cholelithiasis patients, and 40 healthy controls. The feces samples and clinical information of participants were collected in the same period. The gut microbiota and its diversity of individuals were accessed with 16S rDNA sequencing, and the gut microbiota profile was evaluated according to microbiota diversity.

Similar analysis of the FeuN protein highlights short patches of compatibly charged residues on each protein that probably engage one another, giving rise to the downstream effects on target gene expression. The accumulated evidence suggests that the periplasmic interaction between FeuN and FeuQ introduces an intracellular conformational change in FeuQ, resulting in an increase in its ability to remove phosphate from its cognate response regulator FeuP.

Here, we report that, unexpectedly, the S. fredii NGR234 ETR region did not complement deletion of the S. meliloti ETR region in symbiosis with Medicago sativa. This phenotype was due to the bacA gene of NGR234 not being functionally interchangeable with the S. meliloti bacA gene during M. sativa symbiosis. Further analysis revealed that, whereas bacA genes from S. fredii or Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 failed to complement the Fix- phenotype of a S. meliloti bacA mutant with M. sativa, they allowed for further developmental progression prior to a loss of viability.

Some invasive plants have been shown to drastically change the soil microbiome compared to other native plants. The rhizobacteria community structure of BP, two Florida native plants (Hamelia patens and Bidens alba) and bulk soils were characterized across six geographical sites. Although all 19 well-known and 10 poorly described phyla were observed in all plant rhizospheres, BP contained the least total bacterial abundance (OTUs) with a distinct bacteria community structure and clustering patterns differing significantly (pCOA and PERMANOVA) from the natives and bulk soil. The BP rhizosphere community contained the highest overall Proteobacteria diversity (Shannon's diversity 3.25) in spite of a twofold reduction in richness of the Gammaproteobacteria. Remarkably, the invasive BP rhizosphere was highly enriched with Alphaproteobacteria, dominated by Rhizobiales, including Rhodoplanes and Bradyrhizobiaceae. Also, the relative abundance of Spartobacteria under BP rhizosphere was more than twice that of native plants and bulk soil; featuring unique members of the family Chthoniobacteraceae (DA101 genus). The trend was different for the family Pedosphaerae in the phylum Verrucomicrobia where the abundance declined under BP (26%) compared to (33-66%) for the H. patens native plant and bulk soil. BP shared the lowest number of unique phylotypes with bulk soil (146) compared to the other native plants with bulk soil (B. alba - 222, H. patens - 520) suggestive of its capacity to overcome biotic resistance. Although there were no specific biomarkers found, taken together, our data suggests that the occurrence of key bacteria groups across multiple taxonomic ranks provides a somewhat consistent profile of the invasive BP rhizo-community. Furthermore, based on the observed prevalence of a bacteria group (Spartobacteria - Chthoniobacteraceae - DA101); we propose that they have a possible role in BP biology. Our results emphasize the need to further investigate the potential value of unique phylotypes in the rhizosphere relative to bulk soil as an ecological tool for monitoring plant-cover/invasion history; or even detecting exotic plants with invasion tendencies.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,6,0,8,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:29774018,29774018,

These waste plastics, through biological fermentation, could offer alternatives to traditional petrol-based plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of plastics produced by some strains of bacteria that could be part of a new generation of polyester materials that are biodegradable, biocompatible, and, most importantly, non-toxic if discarded. This study introduces the use of prodegraded high impact and general polystyrene (PS0). Polystyrene is commonly used in disposable cutlery, CD cases, trays, and packaging. Despite these applications, some forms of polystyrene PS remain financially and environmentally expensive to send to landfills. The prodegraded PS0 waste plastics used were broken down at varied high temperatures while exposed to ozone. These variables produced PS flakes (PS1⁻3) and a powder (PS4) with individual acid numbers. Consequently, after fermentation, different PHAs and amounts of biomass were produced. The bacterial strain, Cupriavidus necator H16, was selected for this study due to its well-documented genetic profile, stability, robustness, and ability to produce PHAs at relatively low temperatures. The accumulation of PHAs varied from 39% for prodegraded PS0 in nitrogen rich media to 48% (w/w) of dry biomass with the treated PS. The polymers extracted from biomass were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) to assess their molecular structure and properties.

Beneficial microorganisms are known to improve plant tolerance to stresses. Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN (Bp), a beneficial endophytic bacterium, promotes growth of a wide range of plants and induces plant resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses such as coldness and infection by a necrotrophic pathogen. However, mechanisms underlying its role in plant tolerance towards (hemi)biotrophic invaders is still lacking. We thus decipher photosynthetic and defense responses during the interaction between Arabidopsis, Bp and the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst). Different Bp inoculations allowed analyzes at both systemic and local levels. Despite no direct antibacterial action, our results showed that only local presence of Bp alleviates Pst growth in planta during the early stage of infection. Molecular investigations showed that seed inoculation of Bp, leading to a restricted presence in the root system, transiently primed PR1 expression after challenge with Pst but continuously primed PDF1.2 expression. Bacterization with Bp reduced Y(ND) but had no impact on PSII activity or RuBisCO accumulation. Pst infection caused an increase of Y(NA) and a decrease in PhiPSI, ETRI and in PSII activity, showed by a decrease in Fv/Fm, Y(NPQ), PhiPSII, and ETRII values. Inoculation with both bacteria did not display any variation in photosynthetic activity compared to plants inoculated with only Pst.

To further improve the intracellular PHB content, two genes involved in PHB metabolism, phaA and phaB, from the known producer strain Cupriavidus necator, were introduced under the control of the strong promotor PpsbA2. The resulting strain, termed PPT1 (DeltapirC-REphaAB), produced high amounts of PHB under continuous light as well under a day-night regime.

A semi-nested polymerase chain reaction approach using the primer set BCR1/BCR2 followed by BCR1/Mr yielding a 465 bp fragment of the recA gene was applied and tested using both crude lysate from isolated colonies and DNA directly extracted from artificially prepared and spiked reference syrup.

However, recombination rates in other portions of the genome are also high, a feature we expected to disrupt gene order. We analyzed the pangenome of 37 isolates of B. pseudomallei and demonstrate that the pangenome is 'open', with approximately 136 new genes identified with each new genome sequenced, and that the global core genome consists of 4568±16 homologs. Genes associated with metabolism were statistically overrepresented in the core genome, and genes associated with mobile elements, disease, and motility were primarily associated with accessory portions of the pangenome. The frequency distribution of genes present in between 1 and 37 of the genomes analyzed matches well with a model of genome evolution in which 96% of the genome has very low recombination rates but 4% of the genome recombines readily. Using homologous genes among pairs of genomes, we found that gene order was highly conserved among strains, despite the high recombination rates previously observed. High rates of gene transfer and recombination are incompatible with retaining gene order unless these processes are either highly localized to specific sites within the genome, or are characterized by symmetrical gene gain and loss.

The hmp gene, which in Sinorhizobium meliloti encodes a flavohemoglobin involved in NO detoxification, was introduced into M. loti to generate a transconjugant with enhanced NO removal. The symbiotic phenotype of the transconjugant with L. japonicus was examined. The transconjugant showed delayed infection and higher nitrogenase activity in mature nodules than the wild type, whereas nodule senescence was normal. This result is in contrast to previous findings showing that enhanced NO removal in L. japonicus by class 1 phytoglobin affected nodule senescence.

The enhanced expression of class 1 phytoglobin in L. japonicus reduced the amount of NO not only in infected cells, but also in vascular bundles, whereas that of hmp in M. loti reduced the amount of NO in infected cells only.

Plant nurseries importing material from abroad may play an important role in the introduction and spread of diseases such as ash dieback and sudden oak death which are thought to have been introduced through trade. The economic, environmental and social costs associated with the spread of invasive pathogens become considerably larger as the incidence of the pathogen increases. To control the movement of pathogens across the plant trade network it is crucial to develop monitoring programmes at key points of the network such as plant nurseries. By detecting the introduction of invasive pathogens at low incidence, the control and eradication of an epidemic is more likely to be successful. Equally, knowing the likelihood of having sold infected plants once a disease has been detected in a nursery can help designing tracing plans to control the onward spread of the disease. Here, we develop an epidemiological model to detect and track the movement of an invasive plant pathogen into and from a plant nursery. Using statistical methods, we predict the epidemic incidence given that a detection of the pathogen has occurred for the first time, considering that the epidemic has an asymptomatic period between infection and symptom development. Equally, we calculate the probability of having sold at least one infected plant during the period previous to the first disease detection. This analysis can aid stakeholder decisions to determine, when the pathogen is first discovered in a nursery, the need of tracking the disease to other points in the plant trade network in order to control the epidemic. We apply our method to high profile recent introductions including ash dieback and sudden oak death in the UK and citrus canker and Huanglongbing disease in Florida.

We used shotgun DNA sequencing to better understand the link between bacterial community composition and functional capacity in the rhizospheric microbiomes associated with invasive A. dealbata populations in South Africa. Our analysis showed that several genes associated with plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits were significantly overrepresented in the rhizospheric metagenomes compared to neighbouring bulk soils collected away from A. dealbata stands. The majority of these genes are involved in the metabolism of nitrogen, carbohydrates and vitamins, and in various membrane transport systems. Overrepresented genes were linked to a limited number of bacterial taxa, mostly Bradyrhizobium species, the preferred N-fixing rhizobial symbiont of Australian acacias.

The engineering of bioluminescent bacteria required for photonic bioimaging is frequently hampered by lack of promoters suitable for strong, yet stable luciferase gene expression.RESULTS: We devised a novel method for identification of constitutive native promoters in Gram-negative bacteria. The method is based on a Tn5/7 transposon that exploits the unique features of Tn5 (random transposition) and Tn7 (site-specific transposition). The transposons are designed such that Tn5 transposition will allow insertion of a promoter-less bacterial luxCDABE operon downstream of a bacterial gene promoter. Cloning of DNA fragments from luminescent isolates results in a plasmid that replicates in pir (+) hosts. Sequencing of the lux-chromosomal DNA junctions on the plasmid reveals transposon insertion sites within genes or operons. The plasmid is also a mini-Tn7-lux delivery vector that can be used to introduce the promoter-lux operon fusion into other derivatives of the bacterium of interest in an isogenic fashion. Alternatively, promoter-containing sequences can be PCR-amplified from plasmid or chromosomal DNA and cloned into a series of accompanying mini-Tn7-lux vectors. The mini-Tn5/7-lux and mini-Tn7-lux vectors are equipped with diverse selection markers and thus applicable in numerous Gram-negative bacteria. Various mini-Tn5/7-lux vectors were successfully tested for transposition and promoter identification by imaging in Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Strong promoters were captured for lux expression in E. coli and A. baumannii. Some mini-Tn7-lux vectors are also equipped with attB sites for swapping of the lux operon with other reporter genes using Gateway technology.CONCLUSIONS: Although mini-Tn5-lux and mini-Tn7-lux elements have previously been developed and used for bacterial promoter identification and chromosomal insertion of promoter-lux gene fusions, respectively, the newly developed mini-Tn5/7-lux and accompanying accessory plasmids streamline and accelerate the promoter discovery and bioluminescent strain engineering processes.

In this study we used two approaches to predict virulence factors of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. B. pseudomallei is naturally antibiotic resistant and there are no clinically available melioidosis vaccines. To identify B. pseudomallei protein targets for drug discovery and vaccine development, we chose to search for substrates of the B. pseudomallei periplasmic disulfide bond forming protein A (DsbA). DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into extra-cytoplasmic proteins and is essential for virulence in many Gram-negative organism, including B. pseudomallei. The first approach to identify B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates was a large-scale genomic analysis of 511 unique B. pseudomallei disease-associated strains. This yielded 4,496 core gene products, of which we hypothesise 263 are DsbA substrates. Manual curation and database screening of the 263 mature proteins yielded 81 associated with disease pathogenesis or virulence. These were screened for structural homologues to predict potential B-cell epitopes. In the second approach, we searched the B. pseudomallei genome for homologues of the more than 90 known DsbA substrates in other bacteria. Using this approach, we identified 15 putative B. pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates, with two of these previously identified in the genomic approach, bringing the total number of putative DsbA virulence factor substrates to 94.

Here, we describe the 'cheating effect', a form of intra-specific competition that can counterbalance between-species competition, thereby fostering biodiversity in unstructured habitats. Using experimental communities consisting of the strong competitor Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its weaker counterpart Burkholderia cenocepacia (BC), we show that co-existence is impossible when the two species compete for a single limiting resource, iron. However, when introducing a PA cheating mutant, which specifically exploits the iron-scavenging siderophores produced by the PA wild type, we found that biodiversity was preserved under well-mixed conditions where PA cheats could outcompete the PA wild type.

Chronic intestinal inflammation develops against resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. We hypothesized that host intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) G can be used to identify bacteria involved in IBD pathogenesis.RESULTS: IgG-bound and -unbound microorganisms were collected from 32 pediatric terminal ileum aspirate washes during colonoscopy [non-IBD (n=10), Crohn disease (n=15), and ulcerative colitis (n=7)], and composition was assessed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. In vitro analysis of invasive capacity was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and gentamicin invasion assay; immune activation was measured by qPCR. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, IgG binding favored specific and unique mucosa-associated species in pediatric IBD patients. Burkholderia cepacia, Flavonifractor plautii, and Rumminococcus sp. demonstrated increased IgG binding, while Pseudomonas ST29 demonstrated reduced IgG binding, in IBD. In vitro validation confirmed that B. cepacia, F. plautii, and Rumminococcus display invasive potential while Pseudomonas protogens did not.CONCLUSION: Using IgG as a marker of pathobionts in larger patient cohorts to identify microbes and elucidate their role in IBD pathogenesis will potentially underpin new strategies to facilitate development of novel, targeted diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches.

It is essential to understand which regions and areas are suitable for colonization by ACP to formulate appropriate policy and preventive measures. Considering its biology and ecology, we used a machine learning algorithm based on the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) principle, to predict the potential global distribution of ACP using bioclimatic variables and elevation.RESULTS: The model predictions are consistent with the known distribution of ACP and also highlight the potential occurrence outside its current ecological range, that is, primarily in Africa, Asia and the Americas.

Microbial systems have proved extremely useful to test evolutionary theory and identify mechanisms maintaining cooperation. One of the most widely studied system is the secretion and sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores by Pseudomonas bacteria, with many insights gained from this system now being considered as hallmarks of bacterial cooperation. Here, we introduce siderophore secretion by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 as a novel parallel study system, and show that this system behaves differently. For ornibactin, the main siderophore of this species, we discovered a novel mechanism of how cheating can be prevented. Particularly, we found that secreted ornibactin cannot be exploited by ornibactin-defective mutants because ornibactin receptor and synthesis genes are co-expressed from the same operon, such that disruptive mutations in synthesis genes compromise receptor availability required for siderophore uptake and cheating. For pyochelin, the secondary siderophore of this species, we found that cheating was possible, but the relative success of cheaters was positive frequency-dependent, thus diametrically opposite to the Pseudomonas and other microbial systems. Altogether, our results highlight that expanding our repertoire of microbial study systems leads to new discoveries and suggest that there is an enormous diversity of social interactions out there in nature, and we might have only looked at the tip of the iceberg so far.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,0,10,,,,2056-3744,,MEDLINE:31844554,31844554,

In seedling planting, two combinations (Ac/Rh2/Fertilizer D1 and Ac/Rh1/Fertilizer D1) were more effective in increasing seedling growth.

Our results show that the rhizospheric bacterial community was unique for each sampling site, yet the endosphere communities were similar to each other. However, key plant-associated bacterial taxa such as the Rhizobiaceae family were poorly represented in Antarctic samples, probably due to high salinity and heavy metal concentrations in the soil. Metabolic activity in the Antarctic material was considerably lower than in Central European samples. Antarctic root endosphere showed unusually high numbers of certain opportunistic bacterial groups, which proliferated due to low competition conditions.

Initial screening of a B. pseudomallei signature-tagged mutagenesis library identified an attenuated mutant with a transposon insertion in a gene encoding the sensor component of an uncharacterised two-component signal transduction system (TCSTS), which we designated BprRS.RESULTS: Single gene inactivation of either the response regulator gene (bprR) or the sensor histidine kinase gene (bprS) resulted in mutants with reduced swarming motility and reduced virulence in mice. However, a bprRS double mutant was not attenuated for virulence and displayed wild-type levels of motility. The transcriptomes of the bprS, bprR and bprRS mutants were compared with the transcriptome of the parent strain K96243. Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS (bprRS double mutant) resulted in altered expression of only nine genes, including both bprR and bprS, five phage-related genes and bpss0686, encoding a putative 5, 10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase involved in one carbon metabolism. In contrast, the transcriptomes of each of the bprR and bprS single gene mutants revealed more than 70 differentially expressed genes common to both mutants, including regulatory genes and those required for flagella assembly and for the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic polyketide, malleilactone.CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of the entire BprRS TCSTS did not alter virulence or motility and very few genes were differentially expressed indicating that the definitive BprRS regulon is relatively small. However, loss of a single component, either the sensor histidine kinase BprS or its cognate response regulator BprR, resulted in significant transcriptomic and phenotypic differences from the wild-type strain. We hypothesize that the dramatically altered phenotypes of these single mutants are the result of cross-regulation with one or more other TCSTSs and concomitant dysregulation of other key regulatory genes.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,0,7,,,,1471-2164,,MEDLINE:27147217,27147217,

Immobilization of the enzyme on PHA granules resulted in higher catalytic efficiency, increased stability and excellent reusability. The kcat values of the immobilized enzymes increased by threefold compared to that of the free enzyme. The pH stability under acidic conditions was significantly enhanced, and the immobilized enzyme was stable at pH 3.0-11.0. Furthermore, more than 80% of the initial enzyme activity retained after recycling ten times.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a promising approach for cost-efficient in vivo immobilization of a tetrameric organophosphorus degrading enzyme. The immobilization process expands the utility of the enzyme, and may inspire further commercial developments of PHA nano-biocatalysts. As revealed by our results, combination of covalent and non-covalent binding is recommended for display of enzymes on PHA granules.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,0,8,,,,1475-2859,,MEDLINE:31601206,31601206,

In this study, we assessed the effects of biochar application on Radix pseudostellariae plant growth, rhizosphere soil microbial communities, and the physiological properties of microorganisms in a consecutive monoculture system. We found that biochar addition had little impact on the physiological parameters of tissue cultures of R.pseudostellaria but did significantly mediate microbial abundance in the rhizosphere soil of different consecutive monoculture years, leading to decreases in the abundance of pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum, Talaromyces helicus, and Kosakonia sacchari. Furthermore, biochar amendment had negative effects on the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Burkholderia ambifaria, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, and Bacillus pumilus. Metabolomic analysis indicated that biochar significantly influenced the metabolic processes of F.oxysporum while inhibiting the mycelial growth and abating the virulence on plants. In summary, this study details the potential mechanisms responsible for the biochar-stimulated changes in the abundances and metabolism of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi, decreases in the contents of pathogens, and therefore improvements in the environmental conditions for plants growth.

Matrix testing was conducted using 28 cosmetic products to compare the equivalency of the Soleris Bcc method to that of the USP reference method. Repeatability of the Soleris Bcc assay, method robustness, product stability, and lot-to-lot consistency of the Soleris reagents were also assessed.RESULTS: Both the Soleris Bcc and the USP methods supported the growth of all 26 inclusivity strains, except the USP method missed one inclusivity strain in one broth. For exclusivity, 0-6% was presumptive positive with the Soleris Bcc method, and 42-48% was presumptive positive with the reference method. Kappa index was 0.96 for the matrix testing, indicating a good agreement between the Soleris Bcc assay and reference method for testing Bcc in cosmetics. Repeatability results showed the coefficient of variation was less than 4%. The robustness and ruggedness study yielded detection times within 1h differences when small variations were introduced. The lot-to-lot study showed consistent results among four lots of the Bcc reagents.CONCLUSIONS: The automated Soleris method was successfully demonstrated to be robust, sensitive, and specific for Bcc detection in cosmetic products.HIGHLIGHTS: The Soleris Bcc method is user friendly.

Baseline characteristics, clinical characteristics, microbiology, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: Of 200 patients, 42.5% developed SAP after the onset of stroke, and they had a lower proportion of non-smokers (p = 0.002), lower GCS score (p < 0.001), higher serum CRP (p < 0.001) at ICU admission, and a higher proportion of males (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p = 0.039) than patients with non-SAP.

The particular pattern of VOCs was found to be dependent upon the bacterial growth phase (e.g. logarithmic versus stationary) and sample storage conditions (e.g. short-term versus long-term storage at-18 °C).

In this study, an alternative carbon-utilization pathway was constructed in Escherichia coli to enable more efficient beta-carotene production from glycerol. An aldehyde reductase gene (alrd) and an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH) from Ralstonia eutropha H16 were integrated into the E. coli chromosome to form a novel glycerol-utilization pathway. The beta-carotene specific production value was increased by 50% after the introduction of alrd and aldH. It was found that the glycerol kinase gene (garK), alrd and aldH were the bottleneck of the alternative glycerol metabolic pathway, and modulation of garK gene with an mRS library further increased the beta-carotene specific production value by 13%. Finally, co-modulation of genes in the introduced aldH-alrd operon led to 86% more of beta-carotene specific production value than that of the strain without the alternative glycerol-utilization pathway and the glycerol-utilization rate was also increased. In this work, beta-carotene production of E. coli was significantly improved by constructing and optimizing an alternative glycerol-utilization pathway. This strategy can potentially be used to improve the production of other isoprenoids using glycerol as a cheap and abundant substrate, and therefore has industrial relevance.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,0,6,,,,1476-5535,,MEDLINE:29752566,29752566,

Transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescently labeled macrophages and other leukocyte populations enable non-invasive imaging at the optically transparent early life stages. Furthermore, there is a continuously expanding availability of vital reporters for subcellular compartments and for probing activation of immune defense mechanisms.

In particular, the growth-promoting effect of reNFB on invasive plants remains unknown. In this study, 131 strains of potential nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated and purified from the roots of the invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, in Southwest China. Phylogenetically, these reNFB were categorized into three phyla at 97% sequence identity that included Proteobacteria (92.4%), Actinobacteria (4.6%), and Firmicutes (3.1%).

The community composition and diversity of A. adenophora reNFB were markedly different across study regions. The capacity of these reNFB to accumulate indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphate, and produce siderophores was determined. All 131 isolates of reNFB accumulated IAA, 67 isolates solubilized phosphate, and 108 isolates produced siderophores. Among the three dominant genera of reNFB, Pseudomonas had the highest phosphorus solubilization and siderophore production, while the accumulation of IAA in the genus Duganella was the lowest. Interestingly, the calculated reNFB Shannon diversity index of each A. adenophora individual was negatively correlated with the capacity of reNFB to produce growth-promoting products. Six randomly selected isolates from three dominant genera were further used to conduct inoculation experiments, and all isolates showed significant positive growth-promoting effects on A. adenophora seedlings. The contribution of reNFB to the root biomass was higher than that to the shoot biomass. Our results suggest that reNFB, similar to soil or nodular nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can potentially promote plant growth and may play an important role in the invasion of nonleguminous plants.

Their ecological success is partly due to the selective advantage provided by their symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia, which allow legumes to thrive on marginal lands and nitrogen depleted soils where non-symbiotic plants cannot grow. Additionally, their symbiotic capacities result in a high protein content in their aerial parts and seeds. This interesting nutritional value has led to the domestication and agricultural exploitation of several legumes grown for seeds and/or fodder for human and domestic animal consumption. Several cultivated legume species are thus grown far beyond their natural geographic range. Other legume species have become invasives, spreading into new habitats. The cultivation and establishment of legume species outside of their original range requires either that they are introduced or cultivated along with their original symbiotic partner or that they find an efficient symbiotic partner in their introduced habitat. The peanut, Arachis hypogaea, a native of South America, is now cultivated throughout the world. This species forms root nodules with Bradyrhizobium, but it is unclear whether these came with the seeds from their native range or were acquired locally. Here we propose to investigate the phylogeography of Bradyrhizobium spp. associated with a number of different wild and cultivated legume species from a range of geographical areas, including numerous strains isolated from peanut roots across the areas of peanut cultivation. This will allow us to address the question of whether introduced/cultivated peanuts associate with bacteria from their original geographic range, i.e., were introduced together with their original bacterial symbionts, or whether they acquired their current associations de novo from the bacterial community within the area of introduction. We will base the phylogenetic analysis on sequence data from both housekeeping and core genes and a symbiotic gene (nif). Differences between the phylogenetic signal of symbiotic and non-symbiotic genes could result from horizontal transfer of symbiosis capacity. Thus this study will also allow us to elucidate the processes by which this symbiotic association has evolved within this group of Bradyrhizobium spp.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,6,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:31551977,31551977,

To achieve these aims, soil samples were collected from 28 locations in seven biomes throughout South Africa, which were then used to grow V. karroo seedlings under nitrogen-free conditions. The resulting 88 bacterial isolates were identified to genus-level using 16S rRNA sequence analysis and to putative species-level using recA-based phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that the rhizobial isolates represented members of several genera of Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, and Rhizobium), as well as Paraburkholderia from the Betaproteobacteria. Our study therefore greatly increases the known number of Paraburkholderia isolates which can associate with this southern African mimosoid host. We also show for the first time that members of this genus can associate with legumes, not only in the Fynbos biome, but also in the Albany Thicket and Succulent Karoo biomes. Twenty-six putative species were delineated among the 88 isolates, many of which appeared to be new to Science with other likely being conspecific or closely related to E. alkalisoli, M. abyssinicae, M. shonense, and P. tropica.

Support is a key factor in the process of enzyme immobilization used to provide excellent biocompatibility, stable physical and chemical properties and abundant binding sites for enzymes. Thus, various supports, including nanofibers, polymeric monoliths, mesoporous materials, nanomaterials, membrane and cellulose paper, are systematically introduced and discussed in this review.

Engineering of efficient itaconate producers often requires elimination of the highly active isocitrate dehydrogenase to conserve cis-aconitate, leading to 2-ketoglutarate auxotrophy in the producing strains. Supplementation of glutamate or complex protein hydrolysate then becomes necessary, often in large quantities, to support the high cell density desired during itaconate fermentation and adds to the production cost. Here, we present an alternative approach to overcome the glutamate auxotrophy in itaconate producers by synthetically introducing the Weimberg pathway from Burkholderia xenovorans for 2-ketoglutarate biosynthesis. Because of its independence from natural carbohydrate assimilation pathways in Escherichia coli, the Weimberg pathway is able to provide 2-ketoglutarate using xylose without compromising the carbon flux toward itaconate. With xylose concentration carefully tuned to minimize excess 2-ketoglutarate flux in the stationary phase, the final strain accumulated 20g/L of itaconate in minimal medium from 18g/L of xylose and 45g/L of glycerol. Necessity of the recombinant Weimberg pathway for growth also allowed us to maintain multi-copy plasmids carrying in operon the itaconate-producing genes without addition of antibiotics.

Main mode of transmission is via percutaneous inoculation. Pneumonia is the most common presentation in acute disease.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33year old previously healthy Sinhalese female with an occupational exposure to surface water in paddy fields, who was on postpartum day 6 following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery via an elective caesarian section. She presented with a 1day history of breathlessness, preceded by a brief episode of fever. She had occasional right side coarse crackles and pitting oedema of both lower limbs. Shortly after admission, she developed type one respiratory failure needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Initial chest x-ray revealed slight obliteration of right medial diaphragmatic border while echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram excluded a pulmonary embolism, but revealed bilateral multi-lobar consolidation. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated bilateral pyelonephritis with renal abscesses. As initial cultures were inconclusive, melioidosis antibody levels were done due to high degree of suspicion, which was found to be positive with a titer of 1:2560. A diagnosis of melioidosis was made based on the suggestive clinical picture, exposure history and the highly positive antibody level. She developed left side focal seizures together with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was negative for cerebral abscesses but revealed extensive minute haemorrhagic foci throughout the cerebrum. Thus, the final diagnosis was acute melioidosis causing pneumonia and renal abscesses, complicated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and sepsis. She demonstrated dramatic response to high dose meropenem and co-trimoxazole along with plasmapheresis. Four weeks after treatment, the antibody titer came down to 1:320. Melioidosis antibody was absent in the baby.CONCLUSIONS: This case was challenging as it was an atypical presentation of melioidosis during postpartum leading to a diagnostic conundrum. This highlights the need to look into the effect of pregnancy and postpartum as added risk factors.

Swab samples were randomly collected for bacterial culture before patient use from 10 each of the two machine types in August 2001; these included 20 samples from each of the following: Drain tubes, operating water chambers, oscillators, and nebulizing chambers. In addition, 10 samples each of nebulizer solutions before and after use were cultured. For environmental investigation, 10 samples were collected from sinks in the nurse stations of the wards where patients positive for Bcc were hospitalized. Numbers of Bcc isolates were compared before and after introduction of new methods for nebulizer maintenance in October 2001. In addition, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay was applied to find the genetic divergence of the Bcc isolates obtained from clinical samples and nebulizers.RESULTS: From January 1999 to December 2013, a total of 487 Bcc isolates were obtained from clinical specimens from 181 patients. Notably, 322 (66.1%) Bcc isolates were obtained from clinical specimens from 1999 to 2001, including 244 (115 patients) from sputum and 34 (11 patients) from blood. During this period, 14 isolates were obtained from nebulizer components. Among these, six were derived from nebulizer drain tubes, five from operating water chambers, and one from the oscillator before patient use, and two from nebulizer solutions after patient use. When Bcc was isolated from the nebulizer solution after patient use, Bcc was simultaneously detected in other parts of the nebulizer. Bcc was not isolated from any nebulizer solution before use. RAPD assays revealed similar DNA profiles in isolates obtained from patients and nebulizers. Investigation revealed damaged diaphragms in many nebulizers. The new maintenance methods for nebulizers, including restriction of the usage period, thorough disinfection, and routine check for diaphragm breakage, remarkably reduced Bcc isolation (165 isolates from patients in 12 years and 0 isolate from nebulizers in periodical sampling).

Rhamnolipids can be widely applied in many industries including petroleum, food, agriculture and bioremediation etc. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is still the most competent producer of rhamnolipids, but its pathogenicity may cause safety and health concerns during large-scale production and applications. Therefore, extensive studies have been carried out to explore safe and economical methods to produce rhamnolipids. Various metabolic engineering efforts have also been applied to either P. aeruginosa for improving its rhamnolipid production and diminishing its pathogenicity, or to other non-pathogenic strains by introducing the key genes for safe production of rhamnolipids. The three key enzymes for rhamnolipid biosynthesis, RhlA, RhlB and RhlC, are found almost exclusively in Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp., but have been successfully expressed in several non-pathogenic host bacteria to produce rhamnolipids in large scales. The composition of mono- and di-rhamnolipids can also be modified through altering the expression levels of RhlB and RhlC. In addition, cell-free rhamnolipid synthesis by using the key enzymes and precursors from non-pathogenic sources is thought to not only eliminate pathogenic effects and simplify the downstream purification processes, but also to circumvent the complexity of quorum sensing system that regulates rhamnolipid biosynthesis. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa can also be reduced or eliminated through in vivo or in vitro enzymatic degradation of the toxins such as pyocyanin during rhamnolipid production. The rhamnolipid production cost can also be significantly reduced if rhamnolipid purification step can be bypassed, such as utilizing the fermentation broth or the rhamnolipid-producing strains directly in the industrial applications of rhamnolipids.",,,,,,,,,111,3,0,0,70,1,116,,,,1475-2859,,MEDLINE:28779757,28779757,

Thus, studying and engineering the CBB cycle with the associated energy providing pathways to increase the CO2 fixation efficiency of cells is an important subject of biological research with significant application potential.RESULTS: In this work, the autotrophic microbe Ralstonia eutropha (Cupriavidus necator) was selected as a research platform for CBB cycle optimization engineering. By knocking out either CBB operon genes on the operon or mega-plasmid of R. eutropha, we found that both CBB operons were active and contributed almost equally to the carbon fixation process. With similar knock-out experiments, we found both soluble and membrane-bound hydrogenases (SH and MBH), belonging to the energy providing hydrogenase module, were functional during autotrophic growth of R. eutropha. SH played a more significant role. By introducing a heterologous cyanobacterial RuBisCO with the endogenous GroES/EL chaperone system(A quality control systems for proteins consisting of molecular chaperones and proteases, which prevent protein aggregation by either refolding or degrading misfolded proteins) and RbcX(A chaperone in the folding of Rubisco), the culture OD600 of engineered strain increased 89.2% after 72h of autotrophic growth, although the difference was decreased at 96h, indicating cyanobacterial RuBisCO with a higher activity was functional in R. eutropha and lead to improved growth in comparison to the host specific enzyme. Meanwhile, expression of hydrogenases was optimized by modulating the expression of MBH and SH, which could further increase the R. eutropha H16 culture OD600 to 93.4% at 72h.

Three copolymers with different molar proportions of 4-hydroxybutirate (4HB) were used: 16% (PHB16), 30% (PHB30) and 70% (PHB70) 4HB-containing P(3HB-co-4HB). Blank and DCX-loaded nanoparticles were then characterized for their size and size distribution, surface charge, encapsulation efficiency and drug release. Preformulation studies showed that an optimised formulation could be achieved through the emulsification/solvent evaporation method using PHB70 with the addition of 1.0% PVA, as stabilizer and 0.03% VitE-TPGS, as surfactant. DCX-loaded PHB70 nanoparticles (DCX-PHB70) gave the desired particle size distribution in terms of average particle size around 150 nm and narrow particle size distribution (polydispersity index (PDI) below 0.100). The encapsulation efficiency result showed that at 30% w/w drug-to-polymer ratio: DCX- PHB16 NPs were able to encapsulate up to 42% of DCX; DCX-PHB30 NPs encapsulated up to 46% of DCX and DCX-PHB70 NPs encapsulated up to 50% of DCX within the nanoparticle system. Approximately 60% of DCX was released from the DCX-PHB70 NPs within 7 days for 5%, 10% and 20% of drug-to-polymer ratio while for the 30% and 40% drug-to-polymer ratios, an almost complete drug release (98%) after 7 days of incubation was observed.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,0,10,,,2079-4991,,,MEDLINE:33114572,33114572,

Only little is known about mobile genetic elements in these genera which might be important for survival and virulence. Previous studies on Brucella lysogeny indicated that active phages are rare in this genus. To gain insight into the presence and nature of prophages in Ochrobactrum, temperate phages were isolated from various species and characterized in detail. In silico analyses disclosed numerous prophages in published Ochrobactrum genomes. Induction experiments showed that Ochrobactrum prophages can be induced by various stress factors and that some strains released phage particles even under non-induced conditions. Sixty percent of lysates prepared from 125 strains revealed lytic activity. The host range and DNA similarities of 19 phages belonging to the families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, or Podoviridae were determined suggesting that they are highly diverse. Some phages showed relationship to the temperate Brucella inopinata phage BiPB01. The genomic sequences of the myovirus POA1180 (41,655 bp) and podovirus POI1126 (60,065 bp) were analyzed. Phage POA1180 is very similar to a prophage recently identified in a Brucella strain isolated from an exotic frog. The POA1180 genome contains genes which may confer resistance to chromate and the ability to take up sulfate. Phage POI1126 is related to podoviruses of Sinorhizobium meliloti (PCB5), Erwinia pyrifoliae (Pep14), and Burkholderia cenocepacia (BcepIL02) and almost identical to an unnamed plasmid of the Ochrobactrum intermedium strain LMG 3301.

These black rats can transmit a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria of the genus Bartonella, which can cause diseases in humans and animals. In Chile, no data are available identifying fleas from synanthropic rodents as Bartonella vectors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in the fleas of R. rattus in areas with different climate conditions and featuring different human population densities.METHODS: In all, 174 fleas collected from 261 R. rattus captured from 30 localities with different human densities (cities, villages, and wild areas) across five hydrographic zones of Chile (hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and hyper-humid) were examined. Bartonella spp. presence was determined through polymerase chain reaction, using gltA and rpoB genes, which were concatenated to perform a similarity analysis with BLAST and phylogenetic analysis.RESULTS: Overall, 15 fleas species were identified; Bartonella gltA and rpoB fragments were detected in 21.2% (37/174) and 19.5% (34/174) of fleas, respectively. A total of 10 of the 15 fleas species found were positive for Bartonella DNA. Leptopsylla segnis was the most commonly collected flea species (n = 55), and it also presented a high prevalence of Bartonella DNA (P% = 34.5%). The highest numbers of fleas of this species were collected in villages of the arid zone. There were no seasonal differences in the prevalence of Bartonella DNA. The presence of Bartonella DNA in fleas was recorded in all hydrographic areas, and the arid zone presented the highest prevalence of this species. Regarding areas with different human densities, the highest prevalence was noted in the villages (34.8% gltA and 31.8% rpoB), followed by cities (14.8% gltA and 11.1% rpoB) and wild areas (7.4% gltA and 14.8% rpoB). The BLAST analysis showed a high similitude (>96%) with four uncharacterized Bartonella genotypes and with two species with zoonotic potential: B. mastomydis and B. tribocorum. The phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with B. elizabethae and B. tribocorum. This is the first study to provide evidence of the presence of Bartonella in fleas of R. rattus in Chile, indicating that the villages and arid zone correspond to areas with higher infection risk.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,1,11,,,2167-8359,,,MEDLINE:31396444,31396444,

When rhizobia in the genus Mesorhizobium have been introduced with exotic legumes into farming systems, horizontal transfer of symbiosis Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) from the inoculant strain to soil bacteria has resulted in the evolution of ineffective N2-fixing rhizobia that are competitive for nodulation with the target legume. In Australia, Cicer arietinum (chickpea) has been inoculated since the 1970's with Mesorhizobium ciceri sv. ciceri CC1192, a highly effective strain from Israel. Although the full genome sequence of this organism is available, little is known about the mobility of its symbiosis genes and the diversity of cultivated C. arietinum-nodulating organisms. Here, we show the CC1192 genome harbors a 419-kb symbiosis ICE (ICEMcSym1192) and a 648-kb repABC-type plasmid pMC1192 carrying putative fix genes. We sequenced the genomes of 11 C. arietinum nodule isolates from a field site exclusively inoculated with CC1192 and showed they were diverse unrelated Mesorhizobium carrying ICEMcSym1192, indicating they had acquired the ICE by environmental transfer. No exconjugants harboured pMc1192 and the plasmid was not essential for N2 fixation in CC1192. Laboratory conjugation experiments confirmed ICEMcSym1192 is mobile, integrating site-specifically within the 3' end of one of the four ser-tRNA genes in the R7ANS recipient genome. Strikingly, all ICEMcSym1192 exconjugants were as efficient at fixing N2 with C. arietinum as CC1192, demonstrating ICE transfer does not necessarily yield ineffective microsymbionts as previously observed.Importance Symbiotic N2 fixation is a key component of sustainable agriculture and in many parts of the world legumes are inoculated with highly efficient strains of rhizobia to maximise fixed N2 inputs into farming systems. Symbiosis genes for Mesorhizobium spp. are often encoded chromosomally within mobile gene clusters called Integrative and Conjugative Elements or ICEs. In Australia, where all agricultural legumes and their rhizobia are exotic, horizontal transfer of ICEs from inoculant Mesorhizobium strains to native rhizobia has led to the evolution of inefficient strains that outcompete the original inoculant, with the potential to render it ineffective. However, the commercial inoculant strain for Cicer arietinum (chickpea), M. ciceri CC1192, has a mobile symbiosis ICE (ICEMcSym1192) which can support high rates of N2 fixation following either environmental or laboratory transfer into diverse Mesorhizobium backgrounds, demonstrating ICE transfer does not necessarily yield ineffective microsymbionts as previously observed.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,6,0,6,,,,1098-5336,,MEDLINE:33355157,33355157,

Using the lasso method for variable selection, we divided the dataset into training and validation samples (2:1), and developed two multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to calculate probabilities of survival from baseline (T0 model), and from 1year after (T12 model). We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.RESULTS: 4752 people were included. For the T0 model, FEV1; insurance; non-invasive ventilation; supplemental oxygen; Burkholderia colonisation; cirrhosis; depression; dialysis; current smoking; unclassifiable mutation class and cumulative CF exacerbations predicted increased mortality. Baseline transplant evaluation status of 'accepted, on waiting list' predicted decreased mortality.

Moreover, the increasing emergence of drug resistance has led to a decrease in the efficacy of current antifungals. Thus, screening of new antifungal agents is imperative in the fight against antifungal drug resistance. In this study, we show that an endophytic bacterium, Burkholderia gladioli HDXY-02, isolated from the medicinal plant Lycoris aurea, showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against plant and human fungal pathogens. An antifungal ability assay indicated that the bioactive component was produced from strain HDXY-02 having an extracellular secreted component with a molecular weight lower than 1,000 Da. In addition, we found that this new antifungal could be produced effectively by liquid fermentation of HDXY-02. Furthermore, the purified component contributing to the antifungal activity was identified to be toxoflavin, a yellow compound possessing a pyrimido[5,4-e][1,2,4]triazine ring. In vitro bioactivity studies demonstrated that purified toxoflavin from B. gladioli HDXY-02 cultures had a significant antifungal activity against the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, resulting in abolished germination of conidia. More importantly, the growth inhibition by toxoflavin was observed in both wild-type and drug-resistant mutants (cyp51A and non-cyp51A) of A. fumigatus Finally, an optimized protocol for the large-scale production of toxoflavin (1,533mg/liter) has been developed.

Their efficacy was compared to endotracheal aspiration (ETA) and protected specimen brushing (PSB), the standard methods approved for HAP diagnosis.RESULTS: Initially, 56 patients were enrolled. Significant amounts of bacterial pathogens were detected in 48 patients (79 isolates) in Round A and in 39 patients (45 isolates) in Round B (after 72 hours). The sensitivity rates were: ETA 98%, PSB 31%, OS 64% and GA 67% in Round A and ETA 87%, PSB 32%, OS 74% and GA 42% in Round B. Strains of 12 bacterial species were identified in the samples. The three most common etiological agents (both rounds together) were Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.7%), Burkholderia multivorans (21.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.8%).CONCLUSIONS: Blind ETA is an optimum method for obtaining biological samples for identification of etiological agents causing HAP in intubated patients.

A colony of social ants consists of various castes that exhibit distinct lifestyles and is, thus, a unique model for investigating how symbionts may be involved in host eusociality. Yet our knowledge of social ant-symbiont dynamics has remained rudimentary. Through 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing of the carpenter ant Camponotus japonicus symbiont community across various castes, we here report caste-dependent diversity of commensal gut microbiota and lineage divergence of Candidatus Blochmannia, an obligate endosymbiont. While most prevalent gut-associated bacterial populations are found across all castes (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria), we also discovered uncultured populations that are found only in males (belonging to Corynebacteriales, Alkanindiges, and Burkholderia). Most of those populations are not detected in laboratory-maintained queens and workers, suggesting that they are facultative gut symbionts introduced via environmental acquisition. Further inspection of Ca. Blochmannia endosymbionts reveals that two populations are dominant in all individuals across all castes but that males preferentially contain two different sublineages that are diversified from others. Clearly, each caste has distinct symbiont communities, suggesting an overlooked biological aspect of host-symbiont interaction in social insects.IMPORTANCE Social animals, such as primates and some insects, have been shown to exchange symbiotic microbes among individuals through sharing diet or habitats, resulting in increased consistency of microbiota among social partners. The ant is a representative of social insects exhibiting various castes within a colony; queens, males, and nonreproductive females (so-called workers) show distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors but tightly interact with each other in the nest. However, how this social context affects their gut microbiota has remained unclear. In this study, we deeply sequenced the gut symbiont community across various castes of the carpenter ant Camponotus japonicus We report caste-dependent diversity of commensal gut microbial community and lineage divergence of the mutualistic endosymbiont Candidatus Blochmannia. This report sheds light on the hidden diversity in microbial populations and community structure associated with guts of males in social ants.",,,,,,,,,3,1,0,0,2,0,4,,,,2150-7511,,MEDLINE:32317320,32317320,

Interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) span a continuum of specialization, and promiscuous legumes are thought to have higher chances of forming effective symbioses in novel ranges. Using Australian Acacia species in South Africa, it was hypothesized that widespread and highly invasive species will be more generalist in their rhizobial symbiotic requirements and more effective in fixing atmospheric nitrogen compared with localized and less invasive species.Methods: To test these hypotheses, eight localized and 11 widespread acacias were examined using next-generation sequencing data for the nodulation gene, nodC , to compare the identity, species richness, diversity and compositional similarity of rhizobia associated with these acacias. Stable isotope analysis was also used to determine levels of nitrogen obtained from the atmosphere via symbiotic nitrogen fixation.Key Results: No differences were found in richness, diversity and community composition between localized and widespread acacias. Similarly, widespread and localized acacias did not differ in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. However, for some species by site comparisons, significant differences in delta15N isotopic signatures were found, indicating differential symbiotic effectiveness between these species at specific localities.Conclusions: Overall, the results support recent findings that root nodule rhizobial diversity and community composition do not differ between acacias that vary in their invasiveness. Differential invasiveness of acacias in South Africa is probably linked to attributes such as differences in propagule pressure, reasons for (e.g. forestry vs. ornamental) and extent of, plantings in the country.",,,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,13,0,18,,,,1095-8290,,MEDLINE:28369229,28369229,

Six ticks, including Amblyomma triguttatum, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, Haemaphysalis novaeguineae, Ixodes cornuatus, Ixodes holocyclus, and Ixodes tasmani may transmit Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia australis, Rickettsia honei, or Rickettsia honei subsp. marmionii.

In addition, Argas robertsi, Haemaphysalis bancrofti, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes hirsti, Rhipicephalus australis, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks may play active roles in transmission of other pathogens that already exist or could potentially be introduced into Australia.

It is important to regularly update clinicians' knowledge about tick-borne infections because these bacteria and arboviruses are pathogens of humans that may cause fatal illness. An increase in the incidence of tick-borne infections of human may be observed in the future due to changes in demography, climate change, and increase in travel and shipments and even migratory patterns of birds or other animals. Moreover, the geographical conditions of Australia are favorable for many exotic ticks, which may become endemic to Australia given an opportunity. There are some human pathogens, such as Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii that are not currently present in Australia, but can be transmitted by some human-biting ticks found in Australia, such as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, if they enter and establish in this country.

We have previously shown that P. aeruginosa secretes outer-membrane vesicles that deliver a small RNA to human airway epithelial cells (AECs), in which it suppresses the innate immune response. Here, we demonstrate that interdomain communication through small RNA-containing membrane vesicles is bidirectional and that microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by human AECs regulate protein expression, antibiotic sensitivity, and biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa Specifically, human EVs deliver miRNA let-7b-5p to P. aeruginosa, which systematically decreases the abundance of proteins essential for biofilm formation, including PpkA and ClpV1-3, and increases the ability of beta-lactam antibiotics to reduce biofilm formation by targeting the beta-lactamase AmpC. Let-7b-5p is bioinformatically predicted to target not only PpkA, ClpV1, and AmpC in P. aeruginosa but also the corresponding orthologs in Burkholderia cenocepacia, another notorious opportunistic lung pathogen, suggesting that the ability of let-7b-5p to reduce biofilm formation and increase beta-lactam sensitivity is not limited to P. aeruginosa Here, we provide direct evidence for transfer of miRNAs in EVs secreted by eukaryotic cells to a prokaryote, resulting in subsequent phenotypic alterations in the prokaryote as a result of this interdomain communication.

The influence of seasonal variations and mosquito species on mosquito gut microbiota is poorly understood. We sought to determine whether the mosquito microbiota associated with immature stages of two congeners (Culex coronator and Culex nigripalpus) differ temporally and between the two species. Using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we characterized bacterial and archaeal communities found in the immature stages of the two Culex mosquito species sampled over three seasons to compare the diversity of bacteria between the two species. Beta diversity analyses of the larval microbiota sequences revealed that the two Culex species differed significantly, both temporally within each species and between the two species. Bacteria in Cx. coronator larvae were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, mainly associated with Roseoccocus and unidentified species of Rhizobiales, and two unidentified species of Cyanobacteria. In contrast, Cx. nigripalpus was dominated by Thorsellia anophelis (Gammaproteobacteria), Clostridium, an unidentified species of Ruminococcacae (Clostridiales), and additional unidentified species associated with Erysipelotrichaceae (Erysipelotrichales), Bacteroidales, and Mollicutes. Results of our study revealed both seasonal and interspecies differences in bacterial community composition associated with the immature stages of Cx. coronator and Cx. nigripalpus vector populations in Florida. These results have important implications for our understanding of the underlying factors of variations in disease transmission among seasons, susceptibility to various pesticides, and other biotic factors, including the role of the microbiota on the spread of invasive species.

Disease can impact reproduction of elk and cattle, but is seldom considered in wild ruminants when reproductive output declines. We surveyed serological exposure of elk to causative agents in a bovine abortion profile (i.e., agents of brucellosis, leptospirosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea, and neosporosis), as these diseases can negatively affect reproduction of cattle and elk, which frequently co-occur. We determined seroprevalence of exposure to these agents and used hierarchical logistic regression to model both pregnancy and lactation status (a surrogate for calf survival to weaning) as a function of population and exposure to disease causative agents. Tested elk populations were exposed to 2–4 of the agents except for Brucella abortus, which was not present. Pregnancy varied by population (P < 0.016) but not by exposure to any agent (P > 0.213). Proportion of females lactating in autumn did not vary among populations (P > 0.247) nor by exposure to any agent (P > 0.281). Exposure did not affect productivity of elk, despite exposure levels reflective of previous surveys throughout North America and low pregnancy and calf survival in some populations. Because all surveyed elk populations showed exposure to bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), IBR would be the most likely disease to be introduced with elk, although risk is low given high seroprevalence to BHV-1 among cattle in Mexico. Conversely, brucellosis is endemic in Mexico and can significantly impact productivity of elk. Thus, contracting brucellosis from cattle is the highest disease-related threat to elk introductions or translocation in Mexico.","Resumen: Una parte del éxito de las reintroducciones de ciervo wapití (C. elaphus) en México depende de las interacciones y posibles conflictos con el ganado doméstico. Algunos agentes patógenos pueden impactar la reproducción del wapití y al ganado, pero es raro que se considere para los rumiantes silvestres cuando existe un declive en la productividad de la población. Se investigó la exposición a enfermedades de los wapití utilizando un perfil de aborto bovino (e.g. Brucelosis, leptospirosis, rinotraqueitis infecciosa bovina, (RIB), diarrea viral bovina, e infección por Neospora sp.), ya que estas enfermedades pueden afectar negativamente a la reproducción de los bovinos y rumiantes silvestres, y el wapití y el ganado frecuentemente co-ocurren. Utilizamos una regresión logística jerárquica para modelar la proporción de preñez de las hembras en periodo de lactancia (un sustituto para la supervivencia de la cría al destete) como una función de la población y la exposición de las enfermedades reproductivas. Se hicieron pruebas a poblaciones de wapití y fueron expuestos a 2-4 de los agentes patógenos evaluados, excepto para la brucelosis, que no estaba presente. La preñez de las hembras osciló entre 0.73-0.96 y la proporción de supervivencia al pre-destete desde 0.40-0.67 entre poblaciones. La época de preñez varió por población en todos los contrastes (P <0,016), pero no por la exposición a cualquier enfermedad (P> 0,213). La proporción de hembras lactantes en otoño no varió entre las poblaciones (P> 0,247), ni por la exposición a cualquier patógeno (P> 0,281). La exposición a patógenos no afectó la productividad del wapití, a pesar de los niveles de exposición que reflejan previos estudios en Estados Unidos de Norteamérica y la baja preñez y la sobrevivencia de crías entre algunas poblaciones. Debido a su presencia en todas las poblaciones de wapití en Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, si los productores de ganado adyacentes a los sitios de introducción de wapití en México están viendo menos crías que las esperadas, es posible que quieran vigilar su ganado para IBR para ver si BHV-1 puede ser un posible factor contribuyente, ya que el patógeno está relacionado con la reproducción y es probable que esté presente en los wapití.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2448-8445,,,SCIELO:S0065-17372018000100102,,

To date, studies of PSB in soil have largely been performed under field or greenhouse conditions.

In this study, we conducted greenhouse and field experiments to explore the effects of the addition of indigenous PSB on the growth of Chenmou elm (Ulmus chenmoui) and on the diversity and composition of the bacterial community in the soil. We obtained four bacterial isolates with the highest phosphate-solubilizing activity: UC_1 (Pseudomonas sp.), UC_M (Klebsiella sp.), UC_J (Burkholderia sp.), and UC_3 (Chryseobacterium sp.). Sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform showed that the inoculated PSB did not become the dominant strains in the U. chenmoui rhizosphere. However, the soil bacterial community structure was altered by the addition of these PSB. The relative abundance of Chloroflexi decreased significantly in response to PSB application in all treatment groups, whereas the populations of several bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, increased. Network analysis indicated that Chloroflexi was the most strongly negatively correlated with Proteobacteria, whereas Proteobacteria was strongly positively correlated with Bacteroidetes. Our findings indicate that inoculation with PSB (UC_1, UC_M, UC_J, and UC_3) can improve the growth of U. chenmoui and regulate its rhizosphere microbial community.

Recent examples include tree diseases such as sudden oak death in the Western United States and ash dieback in Europe. To control an invading pathogen it is crucial that newly infected sites are quickly detected so that measures can be implemented to control the epidemic. However, since sampling resources are often limited, not all locations can be inspected and locations must be prioritized for surveying. Existing approaches to achieve this are often species specific and rely on detailed data collection and parameterization, which is difficult, especially when new arrivals are unanticipated. Consequently regulatory sampling responses are often ad hoc and developed without due consideration of epidemiology, leading to the suboptimal deployment of expensive sampling resources. We introduce a flexible risk-based sampling method that is pathogen generic and enables available information to be utilized to develop epidemiologically informed sampling programs for virtually any biologically relevant plant pathogen. By targeting risk we aim to inform sampling schemes that identify high-impact locations that can be subsequently treated in order to reduce inoculum in the landscape. This damage limitation is often the initial management objective following the first discovery of a new invader. Risk at each location is determined by the product of the basic reproductive number (R0), as a measure of local epidemic size, and the probability of infection. We illustrate how the risk estimates can be used to prioritize a survey by weighting a random sample so that the highest-risk locations have the highest probability of selection. We demonstrate and test the method using a high-quality spatially and temporally resolved data set on Huanglongbing disease (HLB) in Florida, USA.

Diabetes is best managed by tight glycemic control, as achieving near-normal glucose levels is key to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. Currently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been recognized as the ideal monitoring systems for glycemic control of diabetic patients. Briefly, a CGM system measures blood glucose levels in subcutaneous tissue by attaching a CGM sensor to the skin, allowing the users to make appropriate modifications to their medical interventions according to experience or empirically derived algorithms. The principles of the glucose sensing employed in the current commercially available CGM systems are mainly electrochemical, and employ the gold standard enzyme, glucose oxidase, as the glucose sensing molecule with the combination of hydrogen peroxide monitoring or with the combination of redox mediator harboring hydrogel. Recently, by employing an abiotic synthetic receptor harboring a fluorescent probe combined with a fluorescent detection system, a chronic CGM was commercialized. In addition, the development of less or non-invasive monitoring sensors targeting glucose in tears, sweat, saliva and urine have become of great interest although their clinical relevancy is still controversial.

Imaging suggested interstitial pneumonia and an iliopsoas abscess, and blood tests showed liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite three-agent combined therapy for tuberculosis, she died 32days after hospitalization. PMI showed multiple fresh cerebral and cerebellar infarctions and diffuse ground-glass shadows in bilateral lungs. On autopsy, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis was made, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis that involved the aortic valve may have caused the cerebral infarctions. A 74-year-old man on steroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus presented with severe anemia, melena with no obvious source, and DIC. Imaging suggested intestinal perforation. The patient was treated with antibiotics and drainage of ascites. However, he developed adult respiratory distress syndrome, worsening DIC, and renal dysfunction and died 2months after admission. PMI showed infiltrative lung shadow, ascites, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a wide infarction in the right parietal lobe, and multiple new cerebral infarctions. Autopsy examination showed purulent ascites, diffuse peritonitis, invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis that likely caused the cerebral infarctions.

Here, we review recent research into the molecular mechanisms that control ectomycorrhizal associations in Populus sp. with particular emphasis on the discovery that ectomycorrhizal fungi produce lipochitooligosaccharides capable of activating the common symbiosis pathway. We also present new evidence that lipo-chitooligosaccharides produced by both ectomycorrhizal fungi and various species of rhizobia that do not associate with Populus sp. can induce nuclear calcium spiking in the roots of Populus sp. Thus, we argue Populus sp. already possesses the molecular machinery necessary for perceiving rhizobia, and the next step in engineering symbiosis with rhizobia should be focused on inducing bacterial accommodation and nodule organogenesis. The gene Nodule INception is central to these processes, and several putative orthologs are present in Populus sp. Manipulating the promoters of these genes to match that of plants in the nitrogen-fixing clade may be sufficient to introduce nodulation in Populus sp.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,,,,1559-2324,,MEDLINE:33794743,33794743,

Unlike conventional heterotrophic microorganisms that consume carbohydrates and amino acids, prokaryotic chemolithoautotrophs have evolved the capacity to utilize reduced chemical compounds to fix CO2 and drive metabolic processes. The use of chemolithoautotrophic hosts as production platforms has been renewed by the prospect of metabolically engineered commodity chemicals and fuels. Efforts such as the ARPA-E electrofuels program highlight both the potential and obstacles that chemolithoautotrophic biosynthetic platforms provide. This review surveys the numerous advances that have been made in chemolithoautotrophic metabolic engineering with a focus on hydrogen oxidizing bacteria such as the model chemolithoautotrophic organism (Ralstonia), the purple photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodobacter), and anaerobic acetogens. Two alternative strategies of microbial chassis development are considered: (1) introducing or enhancing autotrophic capabilities (carbon fixation, hydrogen utilization) in model heterotrophic organisms, or (2) improving tools for pathway engineering (transformation methods, promoters, vectors etc.) in native autotrophic organisms.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of presence of microbiological pathogens in graft among lung recipients and frequency of BI, considered as the indicator of severe complications.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was single-center retrospective cohort research; cases of 116 patients with complete microbiological data who underwent LTx from April 2013 to June 2019 were reviewed (70.3% of transplanted patients). All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 25.0 and R 3.5.3. For analyses involving the number of bronchoscopy interventions, univariate and multivariate Poisson regression were used. Interaction effect of variables in multivariate Poisson regression was assessed with partial response plot.RESULTS: The mean number of pathogens colonizing each patient was approximately 4.66 (range, 0 to 19) with Candida albicans (n= 42, 36.2%), Aspergillus spp. (n= 33, 28.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 32, 27.59%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n= 29, 25%) being the most prominent.

Four selectable marker-free transgenic potato (CT) lines expressing cry3A were developed by self-crossing segregation and molecular analyses, including Southern blot, western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays. CT lines were used in a resistance bioassay against CPB in the laboratory and field. In the laboratory, CT lines exhibited high resistance to CPB, and 100% mortality of first-instar larvae occurred 6 days after infestation. In the field, untransformed plant leaves were almost entirely consumed, with an average of 155 larvae present per plant 25 days after inoculation. However, CT lines showed no damage symptoms, with approximately 2.5 larvae surviving per plant.CONCLUSION: We successfully eliminated SMGs from the transgenic potato lines expressing cry3A in order to decrease CPB damage, control the spread of this pest eastwards and alleviate the concern regarding the safe assessment of regulatory requirements. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,9,1,13,,,,1526-4998,,MEDLINE:25820984,25820984,

The use of effective native rhizobia inoculants to promote nitrogen fixation could be beneficial in climbing bean production. In this study, we carried out greenhouse and field experiments to evaluate symbiotic efficiency, compare the effect of native rhizobia and commercial inoculant on nodulation, growth and yield parameters of mid-altitude climbing bean (MAC 13 and MAC 64) varieties. The greenhouse experiment included nine native rhizobia isolates, a consortium of native isolates, commercial inoculant Biofix, a mixture of native isolates + Biofix, nitrogen treated control and a non-inoculated control. In the field experiments, the treatments included the best effective native rhizobia isolate ELM3, a consortium of native isolates, a commercial inoculant Biofix, a mixture of native isolates + Biofix, and a non-inoculated control. Remarkably, four native rhizobia isolates ELM3, ELM4, ELM5, and ELM8 showed higher symbiotic efficiencies compared to the Biofix. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in symbiotic efficiency between the two climbing bean varieties. Field results demonstrated a significant improvement in nodule dry weight and seed yields of MAC 13 and MAC 64 climbing bean varieties upon rhizobia inoculation when compared to the non-inoculated controls. Inoculation with ELM3 isolate resulted to the highest seed yield of 4,397.75 kg ha-1, indicating 89% increase over non-inoculated control (2,334.81 kg ha-1) and 30% increase over Biofix (3,698.79 kg ha-1). Farm site significantly influenced nodule dry weight and seed yields. This study, therefore, revealed the potential of native rhizobia isolates to enhance delivery of agroecosystem services including nitrogen fixation and bean production.

A combination of geochemical analyses, metagenomic sequencing, ex-situ microcosm setups, and statistical analyses were used to investigate the environment-microbe interactions. The microbial communities and metabolic potentials along the terrace were studied by focusing on the genes associated with important biogeochemical processes (i.e., C, N, S cycling and metal resistance). Results show that the variations of geochemical parameters substantially shaped the indigenous microbial communities. Sharp environmental gradients also impacted the microbial metabolic potentials, especially for C, N, and S cycling. Although the relative abundances of carbon fixing genes did not significantly vary along the environmental gradients, the taxa for carbon fixation varied significantly in more contaminated fields versus less contaminated fields, indicating the effects of AMD contamination on the autotrophic microbial communities. AMD input also influenced the N cycling, especially for nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In addition, ex situ experiments were undertaken to evaluate the effects of AMD contamination on nitrogen fixation rates. Random Forest (RF) analysis indicated that nitrate, pH, total N, TOC exhibited positive correlations with the rates of nitrogen fixation while total Fe, Fe(III), and sulfate showed negative effects. Two co-occurrence networks at taxonomic and genomic levels indicated that geochemical parameters such as pH, TOC, total N, total S, and total Fe substantially influenced the innate microbial communities and their metabolic potentials.

Previous field data from the United States has shown that H. longicornis was not associated with natural populations of small mammals or birds, but they show a preference for medium sized mammals in laboratory experiments. Therefore, medium and large sized mammals were sampled on Staten Island, New York, United States, to determine H. longicornis host associations and vector potential for a range of human and veterinary pathogens. A total of 97 hosts were sampled and five species of tick (Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, H. longicornis, Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes cookei) were found feeding concurrently on these hosts. Haemaphysalis longicornis was found in the highest proportions compared with other native tick species on raccoons (55.4%), Virginia opossums (28.9%), and white-tailed deer (11.5%).

However, the repetitive structure of the TALE arrays composing the DBD impedes their generation as gene synthesis product and prevents the delivery of TALE-based genes using lentiviral vectors (LVs), a widely used system for human gene therapy. To overcome these limitations, we aimed at chimerizing the DNA sequence encoding for the TALE-DBDs by introducing sufficient diversity to facilitate both their gene synthesis and enable their lentiviral delivery. To this end, we replaced three out of 17 Xanthomonas TALE repeats with TALE-like units from the bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica. This was combined with extensive codon variation and specific amino acid substitutions throughout the DBD in order to maximize intra- and inter-repeat sequence variability. We demonstrate that chimerized TALEs can be easily generated using conventional Golden Gate cloning strategy or gene synthesis. Moreover, chimerization enabled the delivery of TALE-based designer nucleases, transcriptome and epigenome editors using lentiviral vectors. When delivered as plasmid DNA, chimerized TALEs targeting the CCR5 and CXCR4 loci showed comparable activities in human cells. However, lentiviral delivery of TALE-based transcriptional activators was only successful in the chimerized form. Similarly, delivery of a chimerized CXCR4-specific epigenome editor resulted in rapid silencing of endogenous CXCR4 expression. In conclusion, extensive codon variation and chimerization of TALE-based DBDs enables both the simplified generation and the lentiviral delivery of designer TALEs, and therefore facilitates the clinical application of these tools to precisely edit the genome, transcriptome and epigenome.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,0,6,,,,1422-0067,,MEDLINE:31991825,31991825,

Insight into the complex interaction between gut microbiota and the human adaptive immune system will help guide future immunotherapeutic cancer treatments to allow a more robust clinical response and fewer adverse effects in patients requiring these drugs. This review highlights these interactions as well as the potential for the creation of oncomicrobiotics that would selectively tailor one's GI bacteria to maximally respond to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatments will fewer adverse effects.MAIN BODY: CTLA-4 is an antigen on the surface of T cells which, upon stimulation, leads to inhibition of activated T cells to terminate the immune response. However, many types of tumor cells can upregulate CTLA-4 in the tumor microenvironment, allowing these cells to evade targeting and destruction by the body's immune system by prematurely inhibiting T cells. Increased representation of Bacteroides fragilis, Burkholderia cepacia and the Faecalibacterium genus in the GI tract of patients receiving CTLA-4-based immunotherapy led to a stronger therapeutic effect while minimizing adverse side effects such as colitis. In addition, by introducing bacteria involved in vitamin B and polyamine transport to the GI tracts of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 drugs led to increased resistance to colitis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.PD-1 is another molecule upregulated in many tumor microenvironments which acts in a similar manner to CTLA-4 to tone down the anti-neoplastic actions of T cells. Antibodies to PD-1 have shown promise to help allow the body's natural immune response to appropriately target and destroy tumor cells. The presence of Bifidobacterium breve and longum, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the GI tracts of cancer patients has the potential to create a more robust immune response to anti-PD-1 drugs and prolonged survival.The development of oncomicrobiotics has the potential to help tailor one's gut microbiota to allow patients to maximally respond to immunotherapy without sacrificing increases in toxicity. These oncomicrobiotics may possibly include antibiotics, probiotics, postbiotics and/or prebiotics. However, many challenges lie ahead in the creation of oncomicrobiotics.CONCLUSION: The creation of oncomicrobiotics may allow many patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 immunotherapy to experience prolonged survival and a better quality of life.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,2,0,15,,,1757-4749,,,MEDLINE:32944086,32944086,

The mitochondrion is important in maintaining cellular redox balance and providing the ATP critical for phagocytosis. The focus of this study was to understand how alcohol triggers mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), stimulates cellular oxidative stress, and induces AM dysfunction. The current study also investigated the capacity of the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, mitoTEMPOL (mitoT), in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress, and AM dysfunction. Using in vitro ethanol exposure and AMs from ethanol-fed mice, ethanol promoted mitochondrial dysfunction including increased mitochondrial ROS, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP. Treatment with mitoT reversed these effects. Ethanol-induced decreases in phagocytosis and cell viability were also attenuated with mitoT.

A 2-year field plot experiment verified that the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris increased peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yields and significantly increased nodulation and N2 fixation regardless of whether N fertilizers were added. Root exudates collected from P. liquidambaris-colonized plants significantly improved nodulation and N2 fixation. Rhizosphere stimulation experiments further showed that colonized root exudates had significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3 -) concentrations, with decreased abundance and diversity of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). In contrast, the abundance and diversity of diazotrophs significantly increased, and most diazotrophs identified were peanut nodulation-related strains (Bradyrhizobium sp.). P. liquidambaris symbiosis increased the expression of phenolic and flavonoid synthesis-related genes, and the derived phenolics and flavonoids could effectively increase the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and nodC gene expression (nodulation-related biological processes) of the Bradyrhizobium strain. Metabolic pattern analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids are more likely to accumulate to higher levels in the rhizosphere soil of peanuts colonized with P. liquidambaris Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed the underlying mechanisms for the P. liquidambaris-induced improvement in nodulation and N2 fixation, i.e., that the specific root exudates derived from P. liquidambaris colonization decrease nitrate concentration and increase the population and biological activities of peanut nodulation-related Bradyrhizobium species, which beneficially enhance peanut-Bradyrhizobium interactions. Therefore, this study is the ﬁrst to provide new insight into a positive relationship between an exotic endophytic fungus, crop nodulation, and N2 fixation increase.IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth; however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that endophytic fungal colonization with P. liquidambaris significantly increased the productivity, nodulation, and N2 fixation of peanuts through the secretion of specific root exudates. We provide a reasonable mechanism explaining how P. liquidambaris promotes peanut nodulation and N2 fixation, whereby the specific root exudates produced by P. liquidambaris colonization decrease rhizosphere soil nitrate (NO3-) and increase the population and biological activities of peanut-nodulating-related Bradyrhizobium strains, which is beneficial to enhancing the peanut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic interaction. Our study provides reliable empirical evidence to show the mechanism of how an exotic endophytic fungus drives an increase in nodulation and N2 fixation, which will be helpful in erecting a resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural system.",,,,,,,,,24,1,0,0,21,0,25,,,,2150-7511,,MEDLINE:31311876,31311876,

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the growth of eight species of scandent legumes in five nursery substrates; to compare nodulation with rhizobia strains introduced or native to these substrates; and to characterize phenotypically and genetically these rhizobia. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with five replications. Five to seven months after seedling emergency, according to the legume species, growth and nodulation parameters were determined. Rhizobia identification of strains was carried out by 16S rRNA gene partial sequencing. The survival of seedlings after the transplanting varied from 93 to 98%, in Ultisol (Argissolo in Brazilian classification), collected in primary forest, and fertilized with all nutrients, except nitrogen (ULTfert); and in a clay and sand mixture, in a ratio 3:2 (CONV), respectively. Species with height superior to 30 cm, in general, grew better in substrates with higher fertility: ULTfert and Humic Gley soil (HG). Seven out of the eight species were able to nodulate.

We tested the impact of nitrogen (N) availability and symbionts' presence on mitigating the effects of competition from U. decumbens. Dimorphandra wilsonii seedlings were 50-week pot-cultivated under limiting (3mM) or non-limiting (10mM)N, with or without U. decumbens, and inoculated or not with a N-fixer (Bradyrhizobium sp.) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Glomus etunicatum), both forming symbioses in the field. Since D. wilsonii seedlings grew more and 'lost' fewer nutrients under the symbionts' presence, symbionts mitigated plant-plant competition. Under limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings grew more (despite no nodulation), but N fixation was only suggested when inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings competed with U. decumbens. D. wilsonii13C, and substrate's carbon and respiration suggest that only the microbes performing key functions received plant carbon. Under non-limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings became enriched in 13C, substrate accumulated carbon and microbial respiration increased, suggesting a more generalist microbial community.

However, the limited biogenetic CaCO3 production by bacteria after they were introduced into the incompatible concrete matrix is a major challenge of this technology. In the present study, the potential of combining two metabolic pathways, urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction, simultaneously in one bacteria strain for improving the bacterial CaCO3 yield has been investigated. One bacterial strain, Ralstonia eutropha H16, which has the highest Ca2+ tolerance and is capable of performing both urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction in combined media was selected among three bacterial candidates based on the enzymatic examinations. Results showed that H16 does not need oxygen for urea hydrolysis and urease activity was determined primarily by cell concentration. However, the additional urea in the combined medium slowed down the nitrate reduction rate to 7days until full NO3- decomposition. Moreover, the nitrate reduction of H16 was significantly restricted by an increased Ca2+ ion concentration in the media. Nevertheless, the overall CaCO3 precipitation yield can be improved by 20 to 30% after optimization through the combination of two metabolic pathways. The highest total CaCO3 precipitation yield achieved in an orthogonal experiment was 14g/L.

Diagnosis currently relies on culture; however, this delays appropriate antibiotics and contributes to mortality as results can take up to one week or more. Several non-culture based diagnostic tests are available; however, their role remains a point of contention. This review was performed to characterise the accuracy of various diagnostic tests.METHODS: Medline/Pubmed, CINAHL, Informit, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception to April 2020. Clinical trials investigating diagnostic tests capable of providing results in ≤48 hours using samples from suspected human cases; with bacterial culture as the reference test, and reporting sensitivity and specificity were eligible for inclusion. Data was pooled using bivariate analysis for diagnostic tests reported in ≥4 studies.RESULTS: 22 publications comprising 10963 individual tests were included. Meta-analysis was able to be performed for immunofluorescence assay (sensitivity 63.8% [95% CI, 45.6-78.7%]; specificity 99.4% [95% CI, 97.2-99.9%]), polymerase chain reaction (sensitivity 77.1 [95% CI, 20.8%-97.8%]; specificity 99.8 [95% CI, 91.6%-100.0%]) and lateral flow immunoassay (sensitivity 58.2% [95% CI, 34.1%-78.9%]; specificity 95.0% [95% CI, 93.3%-96.3%]). Measures of sensitivity were overall similar although specificity of immunofluorescence assay was statistically superior to lateral flow immunoassay. There was a trend for reduced sensitivity of direct detection methods applied to blood samples compared to other sample types, although statistically insignificant. Serological methods were unable to be meta-analysed due to an insufficient number of studies, but their sensitivities were generally higher than direct detection methods (median 84% [IQR 71.5-88%] vs 51% [IQR 39-79%]), however they lacked specificity compared to direct detection (median 82% [IQR 70-86%] vs 98% [IQR 95-100%]).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no method showed sensitivity and specificity which would allow it to substitute culture. Serological tests may play a role in ruling out infection in endemic regions given their higher sensitivity, with direct detection methods being used for diagnostic confirmation. Further research into cost-effectiveness and implementation studies are required before diagnostic tests can be introduced clinically in the detection of melioidosis.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,,,,1873-6254,,MEDLINE:33296681,33296681,

These rhizobia, infecting legumes such as lupins, are well established in Polish soils. The studies described here were based on soybean nodulation field experiments, established at the Poznan University of Life Sciences Experiment Station in Gorzyn, Poland, and initiated in the spring of 1994.

Sixty of these isolates were selected randomly and their genotypic characteristics determined using PCR-RFLP of 16S rRNA and intergenic spacer (ITS) genes. Each tree legume was nodulated by isolates classified as fast or very fast-growers or by isolates classified as slow- or very slow-growers with 54% of all the 200 isolates belonging to fast- or very fast-growers.

Combined restriction of the 16S rRNA genes of the 60 rhizobial isolates with five restriction enzymes clearly distinguished seven different clusters at 80% similarity level. The majority of A. lebbeck isolates were distinct from those of the Acacias and L. leucocephala. The M. thonningii isolates were related to L. leucocephala isolates. Simple PCR of the ITS DNA provided several distinct band sizes indicating great variation among the isolates and restriction of the ITS with three different enzymes did not yield many further differences.

Our previous research has challenged this view by showing that, in the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, deletion of the ribBA gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps on the RF biosynthesis pathway only causes a reduction in flavin secretion rather than RF auxotrophy. This finding led us to hypothesize that RibBA participates in the biosynthesis of flavins destined for secretion, whereas S.meliloti has another enzyme that performs this function for internal cellular metabolism. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize a novel formamidase (SMc02977) involved in the production of RF for intracellular functions in S.meliloti. This catalyst, which we named Sm-BrbF, releases formate fromthe early RF precursor 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate to yield 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate. We show that homologs of this enzyme are present in many bacteria, are highly abundant in the Rhizobiales order, and that sequence homologs from Brucella abortus and Liberobacter solanacearum complement the RF auxotrophy of the Sm1021DeltaSMc02977 mutant. Furthermore, we show that the B.abortus enzyme (Bab2_0247, Ba-BrbF) is also an 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate formamidase, and that the bab2_0247 mutant is a RF auxotroph exhibiting a lower level of intracellular infection than the wildtype strain.

We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid 'putting all your eggs in one basket'.

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is one of the PHAs with biocompatibility and fine mechanical properties, but its production is limited by the low level of intracellular propionyl-CoA.RESULTS: L-Isoleucine producing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain WM001 were analyzed by genome and transcriptomesequencing. The results showed that the most over-expressed genes in WM001 are relevant not only to L-isoleucine production but also to propionyl-CoA accumulation. Compared to the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13869, the transcriptional levels of the genes prpC2, prpD2, and prpB2, which are key genes relevant to propionyl-CoA accumulation, increased 26.7, 25.8, and 28.4-folds in WM001, respectively; and the intracellular level of propionyl-CoA increased 16.9-fold in WM001. When the gene cluster phaCAB for PHA biosynthesis was introduced into WM001, the recombinant strain WM001/pDXW-8-phaCAB produced 15.0g/L PHBV with high percentage of 3-hydroxyvalerate as well as 29.8g/L L-isoleucine after fed-batch fermentation. The maximum 3-hydroxyvalerate fraction in PHBV produced by WM001/pDXW-8-phaCAB using glucose as the sole carbon source could reach 72.5%, which is the highest reported so far.CONCLUSIONS: Genome and transcriptome analysis showed that C. glutamicum WM001 has potential to accumulate L-isoleucine and propionyl-CoA pool. This was experimentally confirmed by introducing the phaCAB gene cluster into WM001. The recombinant strain WM001/pDXW-8-phaCAB produced high levels of PHBV with high 3-hydroxyvalerate fraction as well as L-isoleucine.

This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria.

Soil samples were transferred into a greenhouse from three fields previously cultivated with Jatropha for 1, 2, and 15 years, and the two trap legumes were grown in them.

Apart from this particular case, only minor differences were found in the respective compositions of Jatropha soil versus control soil rhizobial populations. Lastly, the structure of these rhizobial populations was systematically imbalanced owing to the overwhelming dominance of a very small number of nifH genotypes, some of which were identical across soil types or even sites.

Loss of enemies from the native habitat, such as parasites and pathogens, can allow for higher invader fitness in the invaded habitat. The presence of mutualists (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers, mycorrhizae, and rhizobial bacteria) in the invaded habitat can facilitate invasion success. Although there has been a great deal of research focusing on how invading hosts may benefit from enemy losses or mutualist gains, far less attention has focused on how native symbiont populations and communities respond to invasion by non-indigenous hosts and symbionts. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework examining how symbionts such as parasites, pathogens, commensals, and mutualists can influence invader success and whether these native symbionts will benefit or decline during invasion. The first major factor in this framework is the competence of the invading host relative to the native hosts. Low- or non-competent hosts that support few if any native symbionts could cause declines in native symbiont taxa. Competent invading hosts could potentially support native parasites, pathogens, commensals, and mutualists, especially if there is a closely related or similar host in the invaded range. These symbionts could inhibit or facilitate invasion or have no discernible effect on the invading host. An understanding of how native symbionts interact with competent versus non-competent invading hosts as well as various invading symbionts is critical to our understanding of invasion success, its consequences for invaded communities and how native symbionts in these communities will fare in the face of invasion.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1939-9170,,MEDLINE:35412657,35412657,

All sera were subjected to the rose-bengal test for B. suis, with positives subjected to the complement fixation test (CFT). Attempts were made to detect B. suis by culture and PCR on CFT-positive samples. All sera were tested separately for the presence of L. pomona and L. hardjo antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test.RESULTS: Of 238 samples tested, 7 were positive (4 with CFT titres ≥ 32) for B. suis antibodies (3% seroprevalence).

It is thought that in many cases of invasive neonatal GBS disease, the bacteria ascend the vagina into the uterus and infect the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. Important constituents of this environment include the polyols or sugar alcohols of which erythritol, sorbitol and mannitol are examples. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of polyols on GBS grown in media containing these sugar alcohols.RESULTS: GBS incubated in varying concentrations of polyols (erythritol, sorbitol or mannitol) did not display any significant enhancement or inhibition of bacterial growth. However, growth of GBS in the presence of erythritol significantly increased the surface expression of GBS-PGK (a plasminogen binding protein) 1.25 to 1.5-fold depending on the erythritol concentration and significantly enhanced the survival in human blood 3X to 18X depending on the concentration of polyol used. Interestingly, GBS grown in 1% erythritol significantly increased invasion by the bacteria of HeLa cells (epithelial cell line) (150% vs 100%) however, at higher concentrations (2% or 4% of polyol) the number of CFUs was significantly reduced (55-75% vs 100%) suggesting higher concentrations of polyols may inhibit invasion. Erythritol also increased GBS hemolytic activity as well as enhancing biofilm formation 1.4X to 3.3X depending on the concentration of polyol used.CONCLUSIONS: GBS grown in the presence of polyols alters the bacteria's phenotype resulting in changes associated with GBS virulence.

To expand on Escherichia coli SCFA products, we previously implemented a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to a diverse group of short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. To increase product titers and reduce premature pathway termination products, we conducted in vivo and in vitro analyses to understand and improve the specificity of the acyl-CoA thioesterase enzyme, which releases fatty acids from CoA. A total of 62 putative bacterial thioesterases, including 23 from the cow rumen microbiome, were inserted into a pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA molecule derived from exogenously provided propionic or isobutyric acid. Functional screening revealed thioesterases that increase production of saturated (valerate), unsaturated (trans-2-pentenoate), and branched (4-methylvalerate) SCFAs compared to overexpression of E. coli thioesterase tesB or native expression of endogenous thioesterases. To determine if altered thioesterase acyl-CoA substrate specificity caused the increase in product titers, six of the most promising enzymes were analyzed in vitro. Biochemical assays revealed that the most productive thioesterases rely on promiscuous activity but have greater specificity for product-associated acyl-CoAs than for precursor acyl-CoAs. In this study, we introduce novel thioesterases with improved specificity for saturated, branched, and unsaturated short-chain acyl-CoAs, thereby expanding the diversity of potential fatty acid products while increasing titers of current products.

In recent years, genome editing techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been highlighted as a new approach to plant breeding. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been widely utilized to generate transgenic plants by introducing plasmid DNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 into plant cells. However, this method has general limitations, such as the limited host range of Agrobacterium and difficulties in tissue culture, including callus induction and regeneration. To avoid these issues, we developed a method to genetically modify germ cells without the need for Agrobacterium-mediated transfection and tissue culture using tobacco as a model. In this study, plasmid DNA containing sequences of Cas9, guide RNA, and fluorescent reporter was introduced into pollen using a biolistic delivery system. Based on the transient expression of fluorescent reporters, the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter was found to be the most suitable promoter for driving the expression of the delivered gene in pollen tubes. We also evaluated the delivery efficiency in male germ cells in the pollen by expression of the introduced fluorescent marker. Mutations were detected in the target gene in the genomic DNA extracted from CRISPR/Cas9-introduced pollen tubes, but were not detected in the negative control. Bombarded pollen germinated pollen tubes and delivered their contents into the ovules in vivo. Although it is necessary to improve biolistic delivery efficiency and establish a method for the screening of genome-modified seeds, our findings provide important insights for the detection and production of genome-modified seeds by pollen biolistic delivery.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,2194-7961,,MEDLINE:34146158,34146158,

However, the infective organisms that survived the journey continue to affect the dynamics of the toad in its new environment. In Australia, the native-range lungworm Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala decreases its host's cardiac capacity, as well as growth and survival, but not rate of dispersal. The lungworm is most prevalent in long-colonised areas within the toads' Australian range, and absent from the invasion front. Several parasites and pathogens of Australian taxa have host-shifted to cane toads in Australia; for example, invasion-front toads are susceptible to spinal arthritis caused by the soil bacterium, Ochrobactrum anthropi. The pentastome Raillietiella frenata has host-shifted to toads and may thereby expand its Australian range due to the continued range expansion of the invasive toads. Spill-over and spill-back of parasites may be detrimental to other host species; however, toads may also reduce parasite loads in native taxa by acting as terminal hosts. We review the impact of the toad's parasites and pathogens on the invasive anuran's biology in Australia, as well as collateral effects of toad-borne parasites and pathogens on other host species in Australia. Both novel and co-evolved pathogens and parasites may have played significant roles in shaping the rapid evolution of immune system responses in cane toads within their invaded range.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,16,0,16,,,2213-2244,,,MEDLINE:30951567,30951567,

Bartonella strains, similar to bacteria detected in indigenous rodents from other African countries, were isolated from the blood of A. niloticus. Bartonellae, similar to bacteria initially cultured from Ornithodorus sonrai (soft tick) from Senegal, were found in two C. gambianus. Interestingly, bartonellae detected in fleas from invasive rats were similar to bacteria identified in indigenous rodents and not their rat hosts, with an overall prevalence of 6.7%. These results suggest that if fleas are competent vectors of these bartonellae, humans residing in these two districts of Uganda are potentially at greater risk for exposure to Bartonella species from native rodents than from invasive rats.

On Marajo Island (Amazon region of Brazil), Marajoara and Puruca horses, which are well adapted to the climatic and territorial adversities of the region, play a fundamental role in the local economy and in the sociocultural lives of the population. However, these animals have undergone a drastic reduction in number, markedly due to precarious veterinary care, unknown causes of morbidity and mortality, and disordered crossing with other breeds introduced to the island. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the occurrence of glanders and brucellosis in equids on a property located in the municipality of Soure, Marajo Island (Brazil). Serum samples were collected from 388 animals (357 horses and 31 mules), maintained in an extensive breeding system, in a property that was also extensively breeding buffaloes, goats, and sheep, with contact among species. The sera were tested for glanders using an indirect ELISA (ELISAi), and the results were confirmed by immunoblotting. The diagnosis of brucellosis was made using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) and confirmed through the Serum Agglutination test (SAT) and 2-mercaptoethanol test. In the case of glanders, 2.31% (9/388) of animals were positive in ELISAi test, of which eight had results confirmed by immunoblotting, representing 2.06% seropositivity in the entire herd. For brucellosis, serum samples from 6.7% (26/388) horses were reactive in the RBT, of which 4.12% (18/388) had a titer ≥50 and 2.06% (8/388) had a titer ≥100 in the SAT. This is the first study to report the occurrence of glanders and equine brucellosis in the municipality of Soure/Marajo Island. Monitoring the occurrence of such diseases is extremely important since they affect the herds economically and zootechnically, in addition to their high zoonotic potential. The number of animals sampled in this study, as well as the way they are raised and managed, is representative of the total equid population of the island.

However, blood sampling is considered an invasive method and may possibly be harmful to the sampled individual. In this study, we investigated the use of ectoparasites as a tool to acquire molecular information about the presence and diversity of infectious microorganism in host populations. We tested the presence of three distinct vector-borne microorganisms in both bat blood and bat flies: Bartonella bacteria, malaria-like Polychromophilus sp. (Apicomplexa), and Trypanosoma sp.

Additionally, we found Bartonella sp. in bat flies from one population in Spain, suggesting its presence in the host population even if not detected in bats. Bartonella and Polychromophilus infection showed the highest prevalence in both bat and bat fly populations. Single, co- and triple infections were also frequently present in both.

The CPR plants have no differences in morphology and growth compared to their wild-type counterparts, but they show strongly enhanced resistance to both bacterial leaf blight, rice blast, and attack of white-backed planthoppers. Caffeine acts as a repellent agent against rice pathogens. Moreover, caffeine triggers a series of Ca2+ signalling-like processes to synthesize salicylic acid (SA), a hormone associated with plant resistance. In CPR, phosphodiesterase was inhibited by caffeine, cAMP and cGMP increased, intracellular Ca2+ increased, phenylalanine lyase (PAL) was activated by OsCPK1, and SA synthesis was activated.

The human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi produces Vi antigen CPS, which contributes to virulence. In a conserved strategy used by bacteria with diverse CPS structures, translocation of Vi antigen to the cell surface is driven by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. These transporters are engaged in heterooligomeric complexes proposed to form an enclosed translocation conduit to the cell surface, allowing the transporter to power the entire process. We identified Vi antigen biosynthesis genetic loci in genera of the Burkholderiales, which are paradoxically distinguished from S. Typhi by encoding VexL, a predicted pectate lyase homolog. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that VexL is an unusual metal-independent endolyase with an acidic pH optimum that is specific for O-acetylated Vi antigen. A 1.22-A crystal structure of the VexL-Vi antigen complex revealed features which distinguish common secreted catabolic pectate lyases from periplasmic VexL, which participates in cell-surface assembly. VexL possesses a right-handed parallel beta-superhelix, of which one face forms an electropositive glycan-binding groove with an extensive hydrogen bonding network that includes Vi antigen acetyl groups and confers substrate specificity. VexL provided a probe to interrogate conserved features of the ABC transporter-dependent export model. When introduced into S Typhi, VexL localized to the periplasm and degraded Vi antigen. In contrast, a cytosolic derivative had no effect unless export was disrupted. These data provide evidence that CPS assembled in ABC transporter-dependent systems is actually exposed to the periplasm during envelope translocation.",,,,,,,,,9,1,0,0,8,0,10,,,,1091-6490,,MEDLINE:29735649,29735649,

Many variants of these protocols have been developed, each with their own strengths. Currently there is no systematic means for simulating sequence data from this family of sequencing protocols, potentially hindering the advancement of algorithms to exploit this new datatype.Findings: We describe a computational simulator that, given simple parameters and reference genome sequences, will simulate Hi-C sequencing on those sequences. The simulator models the basic spatial structure in genomes that is commonly observed in Hi-C and 3C datasets, including the distance-decay relationship in proximity ligation, differences in the frequency of interaction within and across chromosomes, and the structure imposed by cells. A means to model the 3D structure of randomly generated topologically associating domains is provided. The simulator considers several sources of error common to 3C and Hi-C library preparation and sequencing methods, including spurious proximity ligation events and sequencing error.Conclusions: We have introduced the first comprehensive simulator for 3C and Hi-C sequencing protocols.

Using this spectroscopic approach, structural changes in carotenoids, xylan, cellulose and pectin that are associ-ated with this bacterial disease can be determined. 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a phloem-limited Gram-negative bacterium that infects crops worldwide. In North America, two haplotypes of Lso (LsoA and LsoB) are transmitted by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), and infect many solanaceous crops such as potato and tomato. Infected plants exhibit chlorosis, severe stunting, leaf cupping, and scorching. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and potato tuber frying are commonly used methods for diagnostics of the plant disease caused by Lso. However, they are time-consuming, costly, destructive to the sample, and often not sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in the early infection stage. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a noninvasive, nondestructive, analytical technique, which probes chemical composition of analyzed samples. In this study, we demonstrate that Lso infection can be diagnosed by non-invasive spectroscopic analysis of tomato leaves three weeks following infection, before the development of aerial symptoms. In combination with chemometric analyses, Raman spectroscopy allows for 80% accurate diagnostics of Liberibacter disease caused by each of the two different haplotypes. This diagnostics approach is portable and sample agnostic, suggesting that it could be utilized for other crops and could be conducted autonomously.",,,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,19,0,28,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:32048047,32048047,

The basis for this association and hypervirulence of invasive serotype M3 GAS is not fully understood. In this study, the sequenced serotype M3 strain, MGAS315, and serotype M28 strain, MGAS6180, were characterized in parallel to determine whether contemporary M3 GAS has a higher capacity to invade soft tissues than M28 GAS. In subcutaneous infection, MGAS315 invaded almost the whole skin, inhibited neutrophil recruitment and TNF-alpha production, and was lethal in subcutaneous infection of mice, whereas MGAS6180 did not invade skin, induced robust neutrophil infiltration and TNF-alpha production, and failed to kill mice. In contrast to MGAS6180, MGAS315 had covS G1370T mutation. Either replacement of the covS1370T gene with wild-type covS in MGAS315 chromosome or in trans expression of wild-type covS in MGAS315 reduced expression of CovRS-controlled virulence genes hasA, spyCEP, and sse by >10 fold. MGAS315 covSwt lost the capacity to extensively invade skin and to inhibit neutrophil recruitment and had attenuated virulence, indicating that the covS G1370T mutation critically contribute to the hypervirulence of MGAS315. Under the background of functional CovRS, MGAS315 covSwt still caused greater lesions than MGAS6180, and, consistently under the background of covS deletion, MGAS6180 DeltacovS caused smaller lesions than MGAS315 DeltacovS. Thus, contemporary invasive M3 GAS has a higher capacity to evade neutrophil and TNF-alpha responses and to invade soft tissue than M28 GAS and that this skin-invading capacity of M3 GAS is maximized by natural CovRS mutations. These findings enhance our understanding of the basis for the frequent association of M3 GAS with necrotizing fasciitis.",,,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,0,15,,,,1932-6203,,MEDLINE:26047469,26047469,

Fmk1 RNAi fungal transformants showed loss of surface hydrophobicity, reduced invasive growth on tomato fruits and hypo-virulence on tomato seedlings. Hog1 and Pbs2 RNAi transformants showed altered conidial size, and reduced invasive growth and pathogenesis.

The resulting mutant strains and proteins were investigated with respect to their physiological, biochemical, and spectroscopic properties. Replacement of the four invariant conserved cysteine residues, Cys41, Cys44, Cys113, and Cys179, led to unstable protein, strongly supporting their involvement in the coordination of the iron-sulfur cluster proximal to the catalytic [NiFe] center. The Cys41Ser exchange, however, resulted in an SH variant that displayed up to 10% of wild-type activity, suggesting that the coordinating role of Cys41 might be partly substituted by the nearby Cys39 residue, which is present only in O2-tolerant pyridine nucleotide-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Indeed, SH variants carrying glycine, alanine, or serine in place of Cys39 showed increased O2 sensitivity compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of further amino acids typical for O2-tolerant SH representatives did not greatly affect the H2-oxidizing activity in the presence of O2. Remarkably, all mutant enzymes investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy did not reveal significant spectral changes in relation to wild-type SH, showing that the proximal iron-sulfur cluster does not contribute to the wild-type spectrum.

The well-studied Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL binds non-native substrates and encapsulates them in the cavity thereby sequestering the substrates from unfavorable conditions and allowing the substrates to fold. Using this mechanism, GroEL assists folding of about 10-15 % of cellular proteins. Surprisingly, about 30 % of the bacteria express multiple chaperonin genes. The presence of multiple chaperonins raises questions on whether they increase general chaperoning ability in the cell or have developed specific novel cellular roles. Although the latter view is widely supported, evidence for the former is beginning to appear. Some of these chaperonins can functionally replace GroEL in E. coli and are generally indispensable, while others are ineffective and likewise are dispensable. Additionally, moonlighting functions for several chaperonins have been demonstrated, indicating a functional diversity among the chaperonins. Furthermore, proteomic studies have identified diverse substrate pools for multiple chaperonins.

In both applications bacterial suspensions are oftentimes physically introduced into plant tissues using hand-driven pressure from a needleless syringe. While effective, this approach has several drawbacks that limit reproducibility. Pressure must be provided with the syringe perfectly perpendicular to the tissue surface. The researcher must also attempt to provide even and consistent pressure, both within and between experimental replicates. These factors mean that the procedures do not always translate well between research groups or biological replicates.RESULTS: We have devised a method to introduce Agrobacterium suspensions into plant leaves with greater reproducibility. Using a decommissioned dissecting microscope as an armature, a syringe body with the bacterial suspension is mounted to the nosepiece. Gentle, even pressure is applied by rotating the focus knob.

The nematode induces a feeding structure - the syncytium - which it keeps alive for the duration of the life cycle and on which it depends for all nutrients required to develop to the adult stage. Interactions of G. pallida with the host are mediated by effectors, which are produced in two sets of gland cells. These effectors suppress host defences, facilitate migration and induce the formation of the syncytium.RESULTS: The recent completion of the G. pallida genome sequence has allowed us to identify the effector complement from this species. We identify 128 orthologues of effectors from other nematodes as well as 117 novel effector candidates. We have used in situ hybridisation to confirm gland cell expression of a subset of these effectors, demonstrating the validity of our effector identification approach. We have examined the expression profiles of all effector candidates using RNAseq; this analysis shows that the majority of effectors fall into one of three clusters of sequences showing conserved expression characteristics (invasive stage nematode only, parasitic stage only or invasive stage and adult male only). We demonstrate that further diversity in the effector pool is generated by alternative splicing. In addition, we show that effectors target a diverse range of structures in plant cells, including the peroxisome. This is the first identification of effectors from any plant pathogen that target this structure.CONCLUSION: This is the first genome scale search for effectors, combined to a life-cycle expression analysis, for any plant-parasitic nematode. We show that, like other phylogenetically unrelated plant pathogens, plant parasitic nematodes deploy hundreds of effectors in order to parasitise plants, with different effectors required for different phases of the infection process.",,,,,,,,,47,2,0,0,45,0,48,,,,1471-2164,,MEDLINE:25342461,25342461,

Ralstonia eutropha is a biotechnologically useful aerobic bacterium that uses the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) for CO2 utilization, suggesting that it may be a useful host to bioselect RubisCO molecules with improved CO2 -capture capabilities. A host strain of R. eutropha was constructed for this purpose after deleting endogenous genes encoding two related RubisCOs. This strain could be complemented for CO2 -dependent growth by introducing native or heterologous RubisCO genes. Mutagenesis and suppressor selection identified amino acid substitutions in a hydrophobic region that specifically influences RubisCO's interaction with its substrates, particularly O2 , which competes with CO2 at the active site. Unlike most RubisCOs, the R. eutropha enzyme has evolved to retain optimal CO2 -fixation rates in a fast-growing host, despite the presence of high levels of competing O2 . Yet its structure-function properties resemble those of several commonly found RubisCOs, including the higher plant enzymes, allowing strategies to engineer analogous enzymes. Because R. eutropha can be cultured rapidly under harsh environmental conditions (e.g., with toxic industrial flue gas), in the presence of near saturation levels of oxygen, artificial selection and directed evolution studies in this organism could potentially impact efforts toward improving RubisCO-dependent biological CO2 utilization in aerobic environments.ENZYMES: d-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, EC 4.1.1.39; phosphoribulokinase, EC 2.7.1.19.",,,,,,,,,20,1,0,0,14,0,20,,,,1742-4658,,MEDLINE:27261087,27261087,

Nitrate was used for triggering a reduction of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which was expected to rapidly affect carbon allocation dynamics in the root-nodule system. The nitrate treatment led to a decrease in 11C tracer allocation to nodules by 40% to 47% in 5 treated plants while the variation in control plants was less than 11%. The established experimental pipeline enabled for the first time that several plants could consistently be labelled and measured using 11C tracers in a PET approach to quantify C-allocation to individual nodules following a BNF reduction. Our study demonstrates the strength of using 11C tracers in a PET approach for non-invasive quantification of dynamic carbon allocation in several growing plants over several days. A major advantage of the approach is the possibility to investigate carbon dynamics in small regions of interest in a 3D system such as nodules in comparison to whole plant development.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,2223-7747,,,MEDLINE:35270102,35270102,

The transgenic events may serve as novel germplasm resources in alfalfa breeding. Weed competition can reduce the alfalfa yield, generating new alfalfa germplasm with herbicide resistance is essential. To obtain transgenic alfalfa lines with glyphosate resistance, a new synthetic glyphosate-resistant gene GR79Ms encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was introduced into alfalfa germplasm by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. In total, 67 transformants were obtained. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed that GR79Ms was successfully inserted into the genome of alfalfa. Reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analyses further demonstrated the expression of GR79Ms and its product, GR79Ms EPSPS. Moreover, two homozygous transgenic lines were developed in the T2 generation by means of molecular-assisted selection. Herbicide tolerance spray tests showed that the transgenic plants T0-GR1, T0-GR2, T0-GR3 and two homozygous lines were able to tolerate fourfold higher commercial usage of glyphosate than non-transgenic plants.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:29687223,29687223,

The bacterial pathogen causes economic losses because it induces abortion in cattle. Vaccination of calves with live B. abortus strain 19 induces a certain level of protection but induces persistent antibodies against cell envelope lipopolysaccharide that make it difficult to Distinguish Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA). Live vaccine B. abortus strain RB51 was developed to elimínate such interfering antibodies and therefore, facilitate the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals and help in the eradication of the disease. Vaccination with strain RB51 induces levels of protection similar to strain 19 but neither of the two vaccines give complete protection. We have been working to enhance protection induced by strain RB51 vaccine. Protective Brucella antigens can be over-expressed in strain RB51 by introducing a plasmid containing the leuB gene and the genes encoding such antigens. To avoid the expression of antibiotic resistance genes, we produced a leuB deficient strain RB51 and introduced a plasmid containing the leuB gene and the genes to be over-expressed. This new strain maintains the plasmid and has induced significantly high protection levels in mice. In addition, it allowed the construction of an RB51 vaccine strain able to express Mycobacterium bovis protective antigens so that the vaccine could protect against brucellosis and tuberculosis simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0719-8132,,,SCIELO:S0719-81322021000100001,,

Germplasm present in the region is considered to possess several important and unique traits that are of importance in rice improvement programs. Genetic engineering is a powerful tool to introduce new traits into crop plants. However, not much information is available on the methods to introduce foreign genes into North-East rice cultivars. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop transformation procedures for fast recovery of transgenic plants from North-East rice cultivars. To achieve this objective, a systematic study was carried out to identify media components and culture conditions for efficient embryogenic callus induction from the mature seeds and differentiation of callus into plantlets from two North-East deep water rice cultivars, Taothabi and Khongan. Also, role of preculture of callus on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was studied. Co-cultivation of Agrobacterium with 1-5days precultured callus was found to result in high frequency of transformation. Detailed characterization of transgenic lines confirmed stable integration of transgenes and expression of reporter gfp gene. The whole process starting from callus induction to regenerating of transgenic rice plants that can be established in the soil was achieved in about 35-45days. The procedures developed were found to be applicable to a popular variety IR 64.

Cerato ulmin (CU), a hydrophobin secreted by the fungus, has been implicated in the development of DED, but its role in fungal pathogenicity and virulence remains uncertain and controversial. Here, we describe reporter systems based on the CU promoter and three reporter proteins (GFP, GUS and LUC), developed as research tools for quantitative and qualitative studies of DED in vitro, in vivo and in planta. A strain of the aggressive species Ophiostoma novo-ulmi was transformed with the reporter constructs using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the fungal transformants, namely M75-GFP, M75-GUS and M75-LUC, were examined for mitotic stability after repeated subcultures. The intensity of GFP fluorescence was strong in M75-GFP spores and hyphae, allowing microscopic investigations of spore structure, fungal morphogenesis and fungal development. The interaction of M75-GFP and U. americana callus cells was explored with scanning laser confocal microscopy facilitating qualitative studies on fungal strategies for the invasion and penetration of elm cells. M75-GUS was generated to provide an invasive, yet quantitative approach to study fungal-plant interactions in vitro and in planta. The generation of M75-LUC transformants was aimed at providing a non-destructive quantitative approach to study the role of CU in vivo. The sensitivity, low background signal and linearity of LUC assays all predict a very reliable approach to investigate and re-test previously claimed roles of this CU in fungal pathogenicity.

Studies have highlighted the critical role of the soil aqueous phase in shaping interactions among soil bacterial communities. To quantify and improve the attributability of soil aqueous-phase effects, we introduced a synthetic and traceable bacterial community to simple porous microcosms and subjected the community to constant or dynamic hydration conditions. The results were expressed in terms of absolute abundance and show species-specific responses to hydration and nutrient conditions. Hydration dynamics exerted a significant influence on the fraction of less-abundant species, especially after extended incubation periods. Phylogenetic relationships did not explain the group of most abundant species. The ability to quantify species-level dynamics in a bacterial community offers an important step toward deciphering the links between community composition and functions in dynamic terrestrial environments.IMPORTANCE The composition and activity of soil bacteria are central to various ecosystem services and soil biogeochemical cycles. A key factor for soil bacterial activity is soil hydration, which is in a constant state of change due to rainfall, drainage, plant water uptake, and evaporation. These dynamic changes in soil hydration state affect the structure and function of soil bacterial communities in complex ways often unobservable in natural soil. We designed an experimental system that retains the salient features of hydrated soil yet enables systematic evaluation of changes in a representative bacterial community in response to cycles of wetting and drying. The study shows that hydration cycles affect community abundance, yet most changes in composition occur with the less-abundant species (while the successful ones remain dominant).

The introduction of multiple resistance (R) genes with different spectra from crossable species into potato varieties is required. Cisgenesis is a promising approach that introduces native genes from the crops own gene pool using GM technology, thereby retaining favourable characteristics of established varieties.RESULTS: We pursued a cisgenesis approach to introduce two broad spectrum potato late blight R genes, Rpi-sto1 and Rpi-vnt1.1 from the crossable species Solanum stoloniferum and Solanum venturii, respectively, into three different potato varieties. First, single R gene-containing transgenic plants were produced for all varieties to be used as references for the resistance levels and spectra to be expected in the respective genetic backgrounds. Next, a construct containing both cisgenic late blight R genes (Rpi-vnt1.1 and Rpi-sto1), but lacking the bacterial kanamycin resistance selection marker (NPTII) was transformed to the three selected potato varieties using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Gene transfer events were selected by PCR among regenerated shoots. Through further analyses involving morphological evaluations in the greenhouse, responsiveness to Avr genes and late blight resistance in detached leaf assays, the selection was narrowed down to eight independent events. These cisgenic events were selected because they showed broad spectrum late blight resistance due to the activity of both introduced R genes. The marker-free transformation was compared to kanamycin resistance assisted transformation in terms of T-DNA and vector backbone integration frequency. Also, differences in regeneration time and genotype dependency were evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a marker-free transformation pipeline to select potato plants functionally expressing a stack of late blight R genes. Marker-free transformation is less genotype dependent and less prone to vector backbone integration as compared to marker-assisted transformation. Thereby, this study provides an important tool for the successful deployment of R genes in agriculture and contributes to the production of potentially durable late blight resistant potatoes.",,,,,,,,,68,0,1,0,56,0,70,,,,1472-6750,,MEDLINE:24885731,24885731,

Previous studies identified cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) as an indirect inhibitor of antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Here, we identified a putative two-component regulator that suppressed crp mutant phenotypes. Evidence supports that the putative response regulator eepR was directly transcriptionally inhibited by cAMP-CRP. EepR and the putative sensor kinase EepS were necessary for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including prodigiosin- and serratamolide-dependent phenotypes, swarming motility, and hemolysis. Recombinant EepR bound to the prodigiosin and serratamolide promoters in vitro. Together, these data introduce a novel regulator of secondary metabolites that directly connects the broadly conserved metabolism regulator CRP with biosynthetic genes that may contribute to competition with other microbes.IMPORTANCE: This study identifies a new transcription factor that is directly controlled by a broadly conserved transcription factor, CRP. CRP is well studied in its role to help bacteria respond to the amount of nutrients in their environment. The new transcription factor EepR is essential for the bacterium Serratia marcescens to produce two biologically active compounds, prodigiosin and serratamolide. These two compounds are antimicrobial and may allow S. marcescens to compete for limited nutrients with other microorganisms. Results from this study tie together the CRP environmental nutrient sensor with a new regulator of antimicrobial compounds.

Tissue culture is used to establish clonal plants while in vitro flowering allows for the production of flowers or floral parts within a sterile environment, expanding the selection of explants that can be used for tissue culture or genetic transformation. The latter is potentially the most effective, rapid and practical way to introduce new agronomic traits into Dendrobium.

We developed a simple and highly effective potato virus X-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. The VIGS approach was first used to silence the phytoene desaturase gene, which resulted in the expected photo-bleaching phenotype. Next, the VIGS approach was used to silence two additional genes, drought-induced protein gene 15 (ApDRI15) and salinity-induced protein gene 1 (ApSI1). When ApDRI15 was knocked down, the plants were more sensitive to drought stress than the control plants, with smaller leaves, shorter internodes, and lower biomass. The ApDRI15-silenced plants had lower relative water content, lower free proline levels, and higher water loss rates than the control. Silencing of ApSI1 significantly decreased tolerance to salinity, and the ApSI1-silenced plants were withered and smaller. These results indicate that the pgR107 VIGS approach is a simple and highly effective tool for dissecting gene function in A. philoxeroides.

During the last years the number of introduced species was strongly increased (1) by escapees of species cultivated for the nourishment of amphibia and reptilia, as are Blaptica dubia, Gromphadorhina sp., Nauphoeta cinerea, Periplaneta fuliginosa, Shelfordella lateralis and Symploce pallens, and (2) by species presumably imported with gardening materials: Pycnoscelus surinamensis and Phoetalia pallida. The mentioned species have repeatedly been found in human buildings and adjacent gardens of a number of settlements, mostly in the surroundings of the capital Valetta. They seem to be well established there; part of them has even been observed in the wild. The newly introduced species are in spite of their successful establishment and reproduction in Malta not considered as a danger for the indigenous species: The great differences in the requirements between the two groups most likely exclude competition between them. Three species, Ectobius vittiventris, Henschoutedenis flexivitta, and Periplaneta australasiae, have only occasionally been found and can, therefore, scarcely be considered as members of the Maltese fauna; the latter also applies to species of the genus Panchlora which were repeatedly observed on fruit markets at freshly imported bananas, but never found outside, neither in the Maltese banana plantations. Taxonomic part. The new species are described and compared with their closest relatives, colouration and characteristic structures are shown in several figures. Ectobius melitensis belongs to the kraussianus-species group of Ectobius known from Sicily and surrounding islands (Ustica, Aeolian Islands, Ponza), but with one species also reaching Albania; the nearest relatives of Heterogamisca jeffreyana are occurring on the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1175-5334,,MEDLINE:34810951,34810951,

This phenomenon is regulated by small molecule or peptide signals, the best characterized of which are the N-acyl l-homoserine lactones (AHLs) utilized by Gram-negative bacteria. As many QS-controlled phenotypes, notably pathogenicity and symbiosis, can profoundly impact host eukaryotes, there is significant interest in developing methods for modulating QS signaling and either ameliorating or augmenting these phenotypes. One strategy has been the use of non-native AHL analogues to agonize or antagonize specific AHL receptors. This approach is complicated, however, by the potential for prospective hosts to respond to both native AHLs and synthetic analogues. Accordingly, identifying AHL analogues with little or no activity toward eukaryotes is important in developing QS modulation as a strategy for the regulation of prokaryotic behaviors. Herein, we utilize the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize eukaryotic responses to a variety of synthetic AHL analogues to identify structural elements of existing scaffolds that may elicit responses in prospective hosts. Our results indicate that, while many of these compounds have no discernible effect on A. thaliana, some elicit strong phenotypes similar to those produced by auxin, a hormone involved in almost all aspects of plant development. We outline concentrations and chemical scaffolds that are ideal for deployment on plant hosts for the regulation of QS.

Chloroplast transformation has exhibited various positive effects as compared to nuclear transformation. This is a more preferred technique by researchers. To carry out chloroplast transformation, the vector design must be performed, and a selectable marker needs to be incorporated before the chloroplast could uptake the construct. The common way of introducing a gene into the host, which is the chloroplast, involves the biolistic, PEG-mediated, carbon nanotubes carriers, UV-laser microbeam, and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation approaches. Apart from discussing the processes involved in introducing the gene into the chloroplast, this review also focuses on the various applications brought about by chloroplast transformation, particularly in the field of agriculture and environmental science.CONCLUSION: Chloroplast transformation has shown a lot of advantages and proven to be a better alternative compared to nuclear genome transformation.

Despite their clinical impact, surprisingly few microbiological signals associated with PEs have been identified. Here we introduce an unsupervised, systems-oriented approach to identify key members of the microbiota. We used two CF sputum microbiome data sets that were longitudinally collected through periods spanning baseline health and PEs. Key taxa were defined based on three strategies: overall relative abundance, prevalence, and co-occurrence network interconnectedness. We measured the association between changes in the abundance of the key taxa and changes in patient clinical status over time via change-point detection, and found that taxa with the highest level of network interconnectedness tracked changes in patient health significantly better than taxa with the highest abundance or prevalence. We also cross-sectionally stratified all samples into the clinical states and identified key taxa associated with each state. We found that network interconnectedness most strongly delineated the taxa among clinical states, and that anaerobic bacteria were over-represented during PEs. Many of these anaerobes are oropharyngeal bacteria that have been previously isolated from the respiratory tract, and/or have been studied for their role in CF. The observed shift in community structure, and the association of anaerobic taxa and PEs lends further support to the growing consensus that anoxic conditions and the subsequent growth of anaerobic microbes are important predictors of PEs.",,,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,20,0,35,,,,2055-5008,,MEDLINE:30675371,30675371,

The management of such a problem includes the intensive use of insecticides to reduce vector populations and risk of pathogen transmission. As an alternative to synthetic insecticides to control D. citri, the present study determined the chemical composition of diverse plant essential oils and assessed the toxicity and repellency of oil extracts against D. citri. Their chemical composition and abundance were determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Adults and nymphs were exposed to leaf citrus discs treated by spraying or immersion with different oil extract concentrations. Repellency was assessed by exposing adults to treated leaves in experimental arenas and determining the number of insects remaining on the leaf after different time periods compared with the control. The main oil compounds in the tested plants were anethole, verbenone, 4-ethyl-4-methyl-1-hexene, 4-allylanisole, and trans-tagetone. Oils from Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Schinus molle L. caused no repellent or insecticide effects on D. citri. In contrast, oil extracts from the Foeniculum vulgare Mill. and Tagetes species were toxic and/or repellent for both adults and nymphs. There was a positive relationship between toxicity and concentration. Oil extracts from Tagetes lucida, T. coronopifolia, and T. terniflora were repellent (> 92%) at 40 mg mL-1; this was correlated with the concentration and decreased over time. Essential oils extracts from the Tagetes species could represent a potential defense that could be integrated into the management of D. citri.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,2,4,,,0718-5839,,,SCIELO:S0718-58392019000400636,,

Here, we introduced an actin-like mreB homolog from a pseudomonad into Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R (a microsymbiont of Astragalus sinicus L.) and examined the molecular, cellular, and symbiotic phenotypes of the resultant mutant. Exogenous mreB caused an enlarged cell size and slower growth in laboratory medium. However, the mutant formed small, ineffective nodules on A. sinicus (Nod+ Fix-), and rhizobial cells in the infection zone were unable to differentiate into bacteroids. RNA sequencing analysis also revealed minor effects of mreB on global gene expression in free-living cells but larger effects for cells grown in planta. Differentially expressed nodule-specific genes include cell cycle regulators such as the tubulin-like ftsZ1 and ftsZ2. Unlike the ubiquitous FtsZ1, an FtsZ2 homolog was commonly found in Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Mesorhizobium spp. but not in closely related nonsymbiotic species. Bacterial two-hybrid analysis revealed that MreB interacts with FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, which are targeted by the host-derived nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides. Significantly, MreB mutation D283A disrupted the protein-protein interactions and restored the aforementioned phenotypic defects caused by MreB in M. huakuii. Together, our data indicate that MreB is detrimental for modern rhizobia and its interaction with FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 causes the symbiotic process to cease at the late stage of bacteroid differentiation. These findings led to a hypothesis that loss of mreB in the common ancestor of members of Rhizobiales and subsequent acquisition of ftsZ2 are critical evolutionary steps leading to legume-rhizobial symbiosis.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The genomic differences between representative strains of the two symbiovars are, however, relatively small. This introduced a need for a dataset representing a larger bacterial population in order to make better conclusions on characteristics typical for a subset of the species. In this study, we produced draft genomes of eight strains of N. galegae having different symbiotic phenotypes, both with regard to host specificity and nitrogen fixation efficiency. These genomes were analysed together with the previously published complete genomes of N. galegae strains HAMBI 540T and HAMBI 1141.RESULTS: The results showed that the presence of an additional rpoN sigma factor gene in the symbiosis gene region is a characteristic specific to symbiovar orientalis, required for nitrogen fixation. Also the nifQ gene was shown to be crucial for functional symbiosis in both symbiovars. Genome-wide analyses identified additional genes characteristic of strains of the same symbiovar and of strains having similar plant growth promoting properties on Galega orientalis. Many of these genes are involved in transcriptional regulation or in metabolic functions.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that the only symbiosis-related gene that is present in one symbiovar of N. galegae but not in the other is an rpoN gene. The specific function of this gene remains to be determined, however. New genes that were identified as specific for strains of one symbiovar may be involved in determining host specificity, while others are defined as potential determinant genes for differences in efficiency of nitrogen fixation.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,10,0,10,,,,1471-2164,,MEDLINE:25933608,25933608,

Leptocybe invasa is an invasive pest that causes serious damage to eucalyptus plantations, and the thelytokous parthenogenesis, low temperature resistance, protection in galls, generation overlap and small body of L. invasa contribute to its rapid invasion and population growth. However, the endosymbiotic bacterial composition, abundance and sex differences of L. invasa remain unclear. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the bacterial communities in L. invasa adults and compare them between the sexes of L. invasa lineage B.RESULTS: The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to compare bacterial community composition between females and males of L. invasa by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. A total of 1,320 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. These OTUs were subdivided into 24 phyla, 71 classes, 130 orders, 245 families and 501 genera. At the genus level, the dominant bacteria in females and males were Rickettsia and Rhizobium, respectively.CONCLUSION: The endosymbiotic bacteria of L. invasa females and males were highly diverse. There were differences in the bacterial community of L. invasa between sexes, and the bacterial diversity in male specimens was greater than that in female specimens. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of bacterial communities in L. invasa and these data will provide an overall view of the bacterial community in both sexes of L. invasa with special attention on sex-related bacteria.",,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,7,0,8,,,2167-8359,,,MEDLINE:31988811,31988811,

Effective control of invasive pathogens often requires coordinated concerted action of a large group of stakeholders. Both epidemiological and human behavioural factors influence the outcome of a disease control campaign. In mathematical models that are frequently used to guide such campaigns, human behaviour is often ill-represented, if at all. Existing models of human, animal and plant disease that do incorporate participation or compliance are often driven by pay-offs or direct observations of the disease state. It is however very well known that opinion is an important driving factor of human decision making. Here we consider the case study of Citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), which is an acute bacterial disease that threatens the sustainability of citrus production across the world. We show how by coupling an epidemiological model of this invasive disease with an opinion dynamics model we are able to answer the question: What makes or breaks the effectiveness of a disease control campaign? Frequent contact between stakeholders and advisors is shown to increase the probability of successful control. More surprisingly, we show that informing stakeholders about the effectiveness of control methods is of much greater importance than prematurely increasing their perceptions of the risk of infection.

Although plants can be attacked by phytopathogenic bacteria, they are more often engaged in neutral or mutualistic bacterial interactions. In the soil, plants associate with rhizobia or other plant growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria; above ground, bacteria colonise plants as epi- and endophytes. For mounting appropriate responses, such as permitting colonisation by beneficial symbionts while at the same time fending off pathogenic invaders, plants need to distinguish between the good and the bad. Plants make use of proteins containing the lysin motif (LysM) for perception of N-acetylglucosamine containing carbohydrate structures, such as chitooligosaccharides functioning as symbiotic nodulation factors or bacterial peptidoglycan. Moreover, plant hydrolytic enzymes of the chitinase family, which are able to cleave bacterial peptidoglycan or chitooligosaccharides, are essential for cellular signalling induced by rhizobial nodulation factors during symbiosis as well as bacterial peptidoglycan during pathogenesis.

These processes depend on the activity of adenosine ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of GTP-binding proteins and their guanine exchange factors (GEFs). However, knowledge on the function and specificity of individual ARF-GEFs for individual steps of membrane trafficking pathways is still limited in plants.RESULTS: In this work, treatments with various trafficking inhibitors showed that the endocytosis of FM 4-64 is largely dynamin-dependent and relies on proteins containing endocytic tyrosine-based internalization motif and intact cytoskeleton. Interestingly, brefeldin A (BFA), reported previously as an inhibitor of anterograde membrane trafficking in plants, appeared to be the most potent inhibitor of endocytosis in tobacco. In concert with this finding, we demonstrate that the point mutation in the Sec7 domain of the GNOM-LIKE protein1a (NtGNL1a) confers intracellular trafficking pathway-specific BFA resistance. The internalization of FM 4-64 and trafficking of PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) auxin efflux carrier in BY-2 tobacco cells were studied to reveal the function of the ARF-GEF NtGNL1a in these.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our observations uncovered the role of NtGNL1a in endocytosis, including endocytosis of PM proteins (as PIN1 auxin efflux carrier).

Two other clades had mosaic ancestry: sequences for nifD as well as two other SI genes (nifH, nodC) were highly similar or identical to a C. scoparius strain from Spain, while their housekeeping loci belonged to American Bradyrhizobium clades.

This approach is based on a human artificial chromosome made of long synthetic repetitive DNA sequences in which we manipulated the chromatin by tethering the modifiers.

This pipeline introduces artificial PCR fragment-length markers for distinguishing guide RNAs (gRNAs) (FLASH), and a group of 12 constructs harboring different FLASH tags are co-transformed into plants each time. The identities of gRNAs in Agrobacterium mixtures and transgenic plants can therefore be read out by detecting the FLASH tags, a process that requires only conventional PCR and gel electrophoresis rather than sequencing. We generated an arrayed CRISPR library targeting all 1,072 members of the receptor-like kinase(RLK) family in rice. One-shot transformation generated a mutant population that covers gRNAs targeting 955 RLKs, and 74.3% (710/955) of the target genes had three or more independent T0 lines. Our results indicate that the FLASH tags act as bona fide surrogates for the gRNAs and are tightly (92.1%) associated with frameshift mutations in the target genes. In addition, the FLASH pipeline allows for rapid identification of unintended editing events without corresponding T-DNA integrations and generates high-order mutants of closely related RLK genes.

Using this method, many transgenic plants carrying multiple genes-of-interest could be produced without untransformed escape. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a promising biomass crop for bioenergy. To obtain transgenic switchgrass plants carrying a multi-gene trait in a simple manner, an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method was established by constructing a Gateway-based binary vector, optimizing transformation conditions and developing a novel selection method. A MultiRound Gateway-compatible destination binary vector carrying the bar selectable marker gene, pHKGB110, was constructed to introduce multiple genes of interest in a single transformation. Two reporter gene expression cassettes, GUSPlus and gfp, were constructed independently on two entry vectors and then introduced into a single T-DNA region of pHKGB110 via sequential LR reactions. Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA101 carrying the resultant binary vector pHKGB112 and caryopsis-derived compact embryogenic calli were used for transformation experiments. Prolonged cocultivation for 7 days followed by cultivation on media containing meropenem improved transformation efficiency without overgrowth of Agrobacterium, which was, however, not inhibited by cefotaxime or Timentin. In addition, untransformed escape shoots were completely eliminated during the rooting stage by direct dipping the putatively transformed shoots into the herbicide Basta solution for a few seconds, designated as the 'herbicide dipping method'. It was also demonstrated that more than 90 % of the bar-positive transformants carried both reporters delivered from pHKGB112. This simple and reliable transformation method, which incorporates a new selection technique and the use of a MultiRound Gateway-based binary vector, would be suitable for producing a large number of transgenic lines carrying multiple genes.",,,,,,,,,11,2,0,0,7,0,12,,,,1432-203X,,MEDLINE:24700247,24700247,

Because of the increasing resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to INH, mainly associated with mutations in the katG gene, new INH-based compounds have been proposed to circumvent this problem. In this work, we present a detailed comparative study of the molecular determinants of the interactions between wt KatG or its S315T mutant form and either INH or INH-C10, a new acylated INH derivative. MD simulations were used to explore the conformational space of both proteins, and results indicate that the S315T mutation did not have a significant impact on the average size of the access tunnel in the vicinity of these residues. Our simulations also indicate that the steric hindrance role assigned to Asp137 is transient and that electrostatic changes can be important in understanding the enzyme activity data of mutations in KatG. Additionally, molecular docking studies were used to determine the preferred modes of binding of the two substrates. Upon mutation, the apparently less favored docking solution for reaction became the most abundant, suggesting that S315T mutation favors less optimal binding modes. Moreover, the aliphatic tail in INH-C10 seems to bring the hydrazine group closer to the heme, thus favoring the apparent most reactive binding mode, regardless of the enzyme form. The ITC data is in agreement with our interpretation of the C10 alkyl chain role and helped to rationalize the significantly lower experimental MIC value observed for INH-C10. This compound seems to be able to counterbalance most of the conformational restrictions introduced by the mutation, which are thought to be responsible for the decrease in INH activity in the mutated strain.

Consistent with these results, the B. elkanii USDA61 gene for NopF introduced into the Lotus symbiont Mesorhizobium japonicum induced infection inhibition in L. japonicus Gifu, but did not induce any response in L. burttii or L. japonicus MG-20. These results suggest that Lotus accessions possess at least three checkpoints to eliminate unfavorable symbionts, including the post-infection stage, by recognizing different T3SS effector proteins at each checkpoint.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,8,0,10,,,,1347-4405,,MEDLINE:32074548,32074548,

They are well known in Central and South America where they transmit Trypanosoma cruzi to mammals, including humans, through their feces. This parasitic protozoan is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a major public health issue in endemic areas. Because of the medical and economic impact of Chagas disease, the presence of other arthropod-borne pathogens in triatomines was rarely investigated.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, seven triatomines species involved in the transmission of T. cruzi were molecularly screened for the presence of known pathogens generally associated with arthropods, such as Rickettsia, Bartonella, Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia species and Coxiella burnetii. Of all included triatomine species, only Eratyrus mucronatus specimens tested positive for Bartonella species for 56% of tested samples. A new genotype of Bartonella spp. was detected in 13/23 Eratyrus mucronatus specimens, an important vector of T. cruzi to humans. This bacterium was further characterized by sequencing fragments of the ftsZ, gltA and rpoB genes. Depending on the targeted gene, this agent shares 84% to 91% of identity with B. bacilliformis, the agent of Carrion's disease, a deadly sandfly-borne infectious disease endemic in South America. It is also closely related to animal pathogens such as B. bovis and B. chomelii.CONCLUSIONS: As E. mucronatus is an invasive species that occasionally feeds on humans, the presence of potentially pathogenic Bartonella-infected bugs could present another risk for human health, along with the T. cruzi issue.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,13,0,15,,,,1935-2735,,MEDLINE:28095503,28095503,

This has been shown to affect community assembly and physiological processes (e.g., stress tolerance, virulence, or cellular metabolic activity). Metabolic stress is typically quantified by measuring community phenotypic properties such as biomass growth, reactive oxygen species, or cell permeability. However, bulk community measurements do not take into account single-cell phenotypic diversity, which is important for a better understanding and the subsequent management of microbial populations. Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive alternative that provides detailed information on the biochemical makeup of each individual cell. Here, we introduce a method for describing single-cell phenotypic diversity using the Hill diversity framework of Raman spectra. Using the biomolecular profile of individual cells, we obtained a metric to compare cellular states and used it to study stress-induced changes. First, in two Escherichia coli populations either treated with ethanol or nontreated and then in two Saccharomyces cerevisiae subpopulations with either high or low expression of a stress reporter. In both cases, we were able to quantify single-cell phenotypic diversity and to discriminate metabolically stressed cells using a clustering algorithm. We also described how the lipid, protein, and nucleic acid compositions changed after the exposure to the stressor using information from the Raman spectra. Our results show that Raman spectroscopy delivers the necessary resolution to quantify phenotypic diversity within individual cells and that this information can be used to study stress-driven metabolic diversity in microbial populations.IMPORTANCE Microbial cells that live in the same community can exist in different physiological and morphological states that change as a function of spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions. This phenomenon is commonly known as phenotypic heterogeneity and/or diversity. Measuring this plethora of cellular expressions is needed to better understand and manage microbial processes. However, most tools to study phenotypic diversity only average the behavior of the sampled community. In this work, we present a way to quantify the phenotypic diversity of microbial samples by inferring the (bio)molecular profile of its constituent cells using Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate how this tool can be used to quantify the phenotypic diversity that arises after the exposure of microbes to stress. Raman spectroscopy holds potential for the detection of stressed cells in bioproduction.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,2379-5042,,MEDLINE:33115836,33115836,

This work optimized the co-culture conditions of C.vulgaris and bioflocculant-producing bacteria in synthetic wastewater using response surface methodology (RSM), thus aiming to enhance C.vulgaris harvesting and lipid content.

We explored this question by analyzing the genetic and symbiotic evolution of two Bradyrhizobium strains inoculated on Acacia mangium in Malaysia and Senegal 15 and 5 years, respectively, after their introduction. Based on typing of several loci, we showed that these two strains, although closely related and originally sampled in Australia, evolved differently. One strain was recovered in soil with the same five loci as the original isolate, whereas the symbiotic cluster of the other strain was detected with no trace of the three housekeeping genes of the original inoculum. Moreover, the nitrogen fixation efficiency was variable among these isolates (either recombinant or not), with significantly high, low, or similar efficiencies compared to the two original strains and no significant difference between recombinant and nonrecombinant isolates. These data suggested that 15 years after their introduction, nitrogen-fixing bacteria remain in the soil but that closely related inoculant strains may not evolve in the same way, either genetically or symbiotically. In a context of increasing agronomical use of microbial inoculants (for biological control, nitrogen fixation, or plant growth promotion), this result feeds the debate on the consequences associated with such practices.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,,1098-5336,,MEDLINE:25002434,25002434,

Genetic circuits allow responding to these environmental stimuli to optimize physiological adaptations during the switch from the free-living to the symbiotic life style. A pivotal regulatory system of the nitrogen-fixing soybean endosymbiont Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens for efficient symbiosis is the general stress response (GSR), which relies on the alternative sigma factor sigmaEcfG However, the GSR-controlled process required for symbiosis has not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that biosynthesis of trehalose is under GSR control, and mutants lacking the respective biosynthetic genes otsA and/or otsB phenocopy GSR-deficient mutants under symbiotic and selected free-living stress conditions. The role of trehalose as a cytoplasmic chemical chaperone and stress protectant can be functionally replaced in an otsA or otsB mutant by introducing heterologous genetic pathways for biosynthesis of the chemically unrelated compatible solutes glycine betaine and (hydroxy)ectoine. Alternatively, uptake of exogenously provided trehalose also restores efficient symbiosis and tolerance to hyperosmotic and hyperionic stress of otsA mutants. Hence, elevated cytoplasmic trehalose levels resulting from GSR-controlled biosynthesis are crucial for B. diazoefficiens cells to overcome adverse conditions during early stages of host infection and ensure synchronization with root nodule development.IMPORTANCE The Bradyrhizobium-soybean symbiosis is of great agricultural significance and serves as a model system for fundamental research in bacterium-plant interactions. While detailed molecular insight is available about mutual recognition and early nodule organogenesis, our understanding of the host-imposed conditions and the physiology of infecting rhizobia during the transition from a free-living state in the rhizosphere to endosymbiotic bacteroids is currently limited. In this study, we show that the requirement of the rhizobial general stress response (GSR) during host infection is attributable to GSR-controlled biosynthesis of trehalose. Specifically, trehalose is crucial for an efficient symbiosis by acting as a chemical chaperone to protect rhizobia from osmostress during host infection.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,2150-7511,,MEDLINE:33785618,33785618,

We stratified the cohort based on the prevalence of sepsis as defined in the following three ways: quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ≥ 2, clinical suspicion of systemic infection, and qSOFA score ≥ 2 plus suspected systemic infection. We measured clinical characteristics and blood and urine cultures for all patients; antimicrobial sensitivities were assessed for positive cultures. During the study period, 103 patients were admitted and 76 patients were analyzed. The cohort comprised 39% male, and the median age was 30 (interquartile range: 23-40) years. Eighteen (24%), 50 (66%), and 12 patients (16%) had sepsis based on the three definitions, respectively. Four blood cultures (5%) were positive, two from patients with sepsis by all three definitions and two from patients with clinically suspected infection only. All blood bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. Of five patients with urinary tract infection, three had sepsis secondary to multidrug-resistant bacteria. Hospital mortality for patients with sepsis based on the three definitions ranged from 42% to 75% versus 12% to 26% for non-septic patients. In summary, mortality associated with sepsis at this Malawi hospital is high. Bacteremia was infrequently detected, but isolated pathogens were multidrug resistant.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,,,,1476-1645,,MEDLINE:32342843,32342843,

However, the lack of convincing evidence from most informative biomarkers of severe lung dysfunction (SLD-CF) has hampered the formulation of a conclusive, targeted diagnosis of CF. The aim of this study was to determine whether SLD-CF is related to the high concentration of sputum inflammatory mediators and the presence of biofilm-forming bacterial strains. Forty-one patients with advanced CF lung disease were studied. The severity of pulmonary dysfunction was defined by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)<40%. C-reactive protein (CRP) and NLR (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) were examined as representative blood-based markers of inflammation. Expectorated sputum was collected and analysed for cytokines and neutrophil-derived defence proteins. Isolated sputum bacteria were identified and their biofilm-forming capacity was determined. There was no association between FEV1% and total number of sputum bacteria. However, in the high biofilm-forming group the median FEV1 was <40%. Importantly, high density of sputum bacteria was associated with increased concentrations of neutrophil elastase and interleukin (IL)-8 and low concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10. The low concentration of sputum IL-6 is unique for CF and distinct from that observed in other chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. These findings strongly suggest that expectorated sputum is an informative source of pulmonary biomarkers representative for advanced CF and may replace more invasive bronchoalveolar lavage analysis to monitor the disease.

Heavy and light chain gene sequences of a CCP monoclonal antibody (CCP mAb) were cloned from the hybridoma cell (12G1) and introduced into two separate plant expression vectors under the control of the rice alpha-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter system. The vectors were introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. Integration of the CCP mAb genes into rice chromosomes was confirmed by a genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction and expression was verified by northern blot analysis of mRNA. The in vivo assembly and secretion of CCP mAb occurred in transgenic rice cell suspension culture under the RAmy3D expression system; accumulated CCP mAbs in the medium were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. Immunoblot assays and ELISA showed these plant-produced CCP mAbs successfully bound to a synthetic CCP antigen. Taken together, our results suggest that CCP mAb produced in a transgenic rice suspension culture were easily purified and biologically active against their antigen in the RA, and thus may be used a specific serological marker, which is present very early in the RA.",,,,,,,,,5,1,0,0,3,0,6,,,,1573-9368,,MEDLINE:30746589,30746589,

The role of McSnRK1 in controlling Na+ influx and Na/K ratio was demonstrated. SnRK1 kinases (SNF1-related protein kinase1) control metabolic adaptation during energy deprivation and regulate protective mechanisms against environmental stress. Yeast SNF1 activates a P-type ATPase, the Na+ exclusion pump, under glucose starvation. The involvement of plant SnRK1 in salt stress response is largely unknown. We previously identified a salt-induced McSnRK1 in the halophyte ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum). In the current study, the function of McSnRK1 in salt tolerance was analyzed in transgenic cultured cells and roots of ice plant. Ice plant callus constitutively expressed a high level of McSnRK1 and introducing the full-length McSnRK1 did not alter the Na/K ratio at 24h after 200mM NaCl treatment. However, interfering with McSnRK1 activity by introducing a truncate McSnRK1 to produce a dominant-negative form of McSnRK1 increased cellular Na+ accumulation and Na/K ratio. As a result, the growth of cultured cells diminished under salt treatment. Hydroponically grown ice plants with roots expressing full-length McSnRK1 had better growth and lowered Na/K ratio compared to the wild-type or vector-only plants. Roots expressing a truncate McSnRK1 had reduced growth and high Na/K ratio under 400mM NaCl treatment. The changes in Na/K ratio in transgenic cells and whole plants demonstrated the function of SnRK1 in controlling Na+ flux and maintaining Na/K homeostasis under salinity. The Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system could be a versatile tool for functional analysis of genes involved in salt tolerance in the ice plant.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,,1432-203X,,MEDLINE:31037366,31037366,

The primary routes of infection in field settings have been described, but it is not known how the bovine host shapes the structure of B. abortus populations during infection. We utilized a library of uniquely barcoded B. abortus strains to temporally and spatially quantify population structure during colonization of cattle through a natural route of infection. Introducing 108 bacteria from this barcoded library to the conjunctival mucosa resulted in expected levels of local lymph node colonization at a 1-wk time point. We leveraged variance in strain abundance in the library to demonstrate that only 1 in 10,000 brucellae introduced at the site of infection reached a parotid lymph node. Thus, cattle restrict the overwhelming majority of B. abortus introduced via the ocular conjunctiva at this dose. Individual strains were spatially restricted within the host tissue, and the total B. abortus census was dominated by a small number of distinct strains in each lymph node. These results define a bottleneck that B. abortus must traverse to colonize local lymph nodes from the conjunctival mucosa. The data further support a model in which a small number of spatially isolated granulomas founded by unique strains are present at 1 wk postinfection. These experiments demonstrate the power of barcoded transposon tools to quantify infection bottlenecks and to define pathogen population structure in host tissues.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,,1091-6490,,MEDLINE:33688053,33688053,

When the CANON reactor was transformed to simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) reactor by introducing organic material, the denitrifiers and aerobic heterotrophic bacteria would compete nitrite or oxygen with NOB, which then led to the biodiversity decreasing of both Nitrobacter-like NOB and Nitrospira-like NOB.

This study evaluated the efficiency (sensitivity related to cost) of the French bovine brucellosis surveillance system using stochastic scenario tree models. Cattle herds were categorized into three risk groups based on the annual number of purchases, given that trading is considered as the main route of brucellosis introduction in cattle herds. The sensitivity in detecting the disease and the costs of the current surveillance system, which includes clinical (abortion) surveillance, programmed serological testing and introduction controls, were compared to those of 19 alternative surveillance scenarios. Surveillance costs included veterinary fees and laboratory analyses. The sensitivity over a year of the current surveillance system was predicted to be 91±7% at a design prevalence of 0.01% for a total cost of 14.9±1.8 million . Several alternative surveillance scenarios, based on clinical surveillance and random or risk-based serological screening in a sample (20%) of the population, were predicted to be at least as sensitive but for a lower cost.

To gain an initial insight into BP's mycorrhizal associations, this study examined the rhizobiome of BP and two native plants (Hamelia patens and Bidens alba) across six locations. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with the roots of the target plants and bulk soil was characterized by spore morphotyping. Sequence analysis of metagenomic DNA from lateral roots/rhizosphere of BP (n = 52) and a native shrub H. patens (n = 37) on the same parcel yielded other fungal associates. Overall, the total population of AMF associated with BP was about two folds greater than that of the two native plants (p = 0.0001) growing on the same site. The dominant AMF under Schinus were members of the common Glomus and Rhizophagus spp. By contrast, the most prevalent AMF in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the two Florida native plants, Acaulospora spp (29%) was sharply diminished (9%) under BP rhizosphere. Analysis of the ITS2 sequences also showed that Schinus rhizosphere had a high relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (76.5%) compared to the native H. patens (2.6%), with the species Lactifluus hygrophoroides (Basidiomycota) being the most prevalent at 61.5% (p < 0.05). Unlike the native plants where pathogenic fungi like Phyllosticta sp., Phoma sp., and Neofusicoccum andium were present (8.1% for H. patens), only one potentially pathogenic fungal taxon was detected (3.9%) under BP. The striking disparity in the relative abundance of AMF and other fungal types between BP and the native species is quite significant. Fungal symbionts could aide plant invasion via resource-use efficiency and other poorly defined mechanisms of protection from pathogens in their invaded range.

However, the nature of the relationship between Microcystis and its microbiome remains unclear. Is it a long-term, evolutionarily stable association? Which partners benefit? Here we report the genomic diversity of 109 individual Microcystis colonies-including cyanobacteria and associated bacterial genomes-isolated in situ and without culture from Lake Champlain, Canada and Pampulha Reservoir, Brazil.RESULTS: We identified 14 distinct Microcystis genotypes from Canada, of which only two have been previously reported, and four genotypes specific to Brazil. Microcystis genetic diversity was much greater between than within colonies, consistent with colony growth by clonal expansion rather than aggregation of Microcystis cells. We also identified 72 bacterial species in the microbiome. Each Microcystis genotype had a distinct microbiome composition, and more closely related genotypes had more similar microbiomes. This pattern of phylosymbiosis could be explained by co-phylogeny in only two out of the nine most prevalent associated bacterial genera, Roseomonas and Rhodobacter. These phylogenetically associated genera could enrich the metabolic repertoire of Microcystis, for example by encoding the biosynthesis of complementary carotenoid molecules. In contrast, other colony-associated bacteria showed weaker signals of co-phylogeny, but stronger evidence of horizontal gene transfer with Microcystis. These observations suggest that acquired genes are more likely to be retained in both partners (Microcystis and members of its microbiome) when they are loosely associated, whereas one gene copy is sufficient when the association is physically tight and evolutionarily long-lasting.CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced a method for culture-free isolation of single colonies from nature followed by metagenomic sequencing, which could be applied to other types of microbes. Together, our results expand the known genetic diversity of both Microcystis and its microbiome in natural settings, and support their long-term, specific, and potentially beneficial associations.

Along with many other agricultural technologies, the global production of genetically engineered crops has steadily grown since they were first introduced 25 years ago. Since the first transfer of DNA into plant cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, different transformation methods have enabled rapid advances in molecular breeding approaches to bring crop varieties with novel traits to the market that would be difficult or not possible to achieve with conventional breeding methods. Today, transformation to produce genetically engineered crops is the fastest and most widely adopted technology in agriculture. The rapidly increasing number of sequenced plant genomes and information from functional genomics data to understand gene function, together with novel gene cloning and tissue culture methods, is further accelerating crop improvement and trait development. These advances are welcome and needed to make crops more resilient to climate change and to secure their yield for feeding the increasing human population. Despite the success, transformation remains a bottleneck because many plant species and crop genotypes are recalcitrant to established tissue culture and regeneration conditions, or they show poor transformability. Improvements are possible using morphogenetic transcriptional regulators, but their broader applicability remains to be tested. Advances in genome editing techniques and direct, non-tissue culture-based transformation methods offer alternative approaches to enhance varietal development in other recalcitrant crops. Here, we review recent developments in plant transformation and regeneration, and discuss opportunities for new breeding technologies in agriculture.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,0,10,,,,1618-1328,,MEDLINE:33872932,33872932,

This method provided an interesting tool for metabolic engineering of seed crops. Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an important oil crop with many excellent agronomic traits. This model oil plant has been exploited to accumulate value-added bioproducts using genetic manipulation that depends on antibiotic- or herbicide-based selection marker genes (SMG), one of the major concerns for genetically modified foods. Here we reported metabolic engineering of C. sativa to synthesize red ketocarotenoids that could serve as a reporter to visualize transgenic events without using a traditional SMG. Overexpression of a non-native beta-carotene ketolase gene coupled with three other carotenogenous genes (phytoene synthase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, and Orange) in C. sativa resulted in production of red seeds that were visibly distinguishable from the normal yellow ones. Constitutive expression of the transgenes led to delayed plant development and seed germination. In contrast, seed-specific transformants demonstrated normal growth and seed germination despite the accumulation of up to 70-fold the level of carotenoids in the seeds compared to the controls, including significant amounts of astaxanthin and keto-lutein. As a result, the transgenic seed oils exhibited much higher antioxidant activity. No significant changes were found in the profiles of fatty acids between transgenic and control seeds.

In this study, we monitored the effect of a single bacterial strain inoculation on the diversity, structure, and cooperation in plant-associated microbiome over 1-year period. An endophyte (RF67) isolated from Vaccinium angustifolium (wild blueberry) roots and annotated as Rhizobium was used for the inoculation of 1-year-old Lonicera caerulea (Haskap) plants. A significant level of bacterial community perturbation was detected in plant roots after 3 months post-inoculation. About 23% of root-associated community variation was correlated with an application of the inoculant, which was accompanied by increased cooperation between taxa belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota phyla and decreased cooperation between Firmicutes in plant roots. Additionally, a decrease in bacterial Shannon diversity and an increase in the relative abundances of Rhizobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were detected in the roots of inoculated plants relative to the non-inoculated control. A strong effect of the inoculation on the bacterial cooperation was also detected after 1 year of plant field growth, whereas no differences in bacterial community composition and also alpha and beta diversities were detected between bacterial communities from inoculated and non-inoculated roots.

Under ABA treatment, the plants in which OsANN4 was knocked down by RNA interference showed some visible phenotypic changes compared to the wild type, such as a lower rooting rate and shorter shoot and root lengths. Moreover, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities of the RNAi lines were significantly lower and further resulted in higher accumulation of O2.- and H2O2 than those of the wild-type. A Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) assay showed that ABA-induced net Ca2+ influx was inhibited in OsANN4 knockdown plants. Interestingly, the phenotypic differences caused by ABA were eliminated in the presence of LaCl3 (Ca2+ channel inhibitor).

Therefore, the IPUT1 gene plays an important role in the genetic improvement of crop salt tolerance. Herein, the IbIPUT1 gene, which encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtIPUT1, from sweet potato was cloned. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated in vivo transgenic technology, non-invasive micro-measuring technology (NMT) and Na+ fluorescence imaging technology were then combined to quickly study the potential function of IbIPUT1 in salt tolerance. The data showed that IbIPUT1 was involved in the regulation of root cell Na+ balance, and the overexpression of IbIPUT1 could not promote sweet potato root cell Na+ efflux under salt stress, but it could significantly inhibit the Na+ absorption of root cells, thereby reducing the accumulation of Na+ in root cells under salt stress. Additionally, Ca2+ efflux in transgenic root cells was slightly higher than that in control roots under salt stress. Collectively, an efficient transgenic method for gene function studies was established, and our results suggested that IbIPUT1 acts as a candidate gene for the genetic enhancement of sweet potato salt tolerance.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2073-4425,,MEDLINE:35885923,35885923,

Here, pH-dependent complementation assays using yeast mutants sec24Delta/SEC24 and sec27Delta/SEC27 showed that OsSEC27 could functionally complement SEC24 but not SEC27 in yeast; thus, it was renamed as OsSEC24. We found that OsSEC24-transgenic tobacco plants increased the length and number of roots under iron deficiency at pH 8.0. To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts. H(+) flux measurements using Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) indicated that the transgenic OsSEC24 tobacco and rice enhanced H(+) efflux under iron deficiency. Conversely, the application of plasma membrane PM-H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate elucidated that H(+) secretion increased by OsSEC24 was mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase. OsPMA2 was used as a representative of iron deficiency-responsive PM-H(+)-ATPases in rice root via RT-PCR analysis.

Genome-wide SNP data revealed two major genetic clusters-psyllids collected from potato crops were genetically similar to psyllids found on a common weed, Lycium spp., but dissimilar from those found on another common non-crop host, Solanum dulcamara L. Most psyllids found on Lycium spp. and potato represented a single mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotype that has been suggested to not be native to the region, and whose arrival may have been concurrent with zebra chip disease first emerging. The putatively introduced COI haplotype usually co-occurred with endosymbiotic Wolbachia, while the putatively resident COI haplotype generally did not. Genetic intermediates between the two genetic populations of insects were rare, consistent with recent sympatry or reproductive isolation, although admixture patterns of apparent hybrids were consistent with introgression of genes from introduced into resident populations. Our results suggest that both host-plant associations and endosymbionts are shaping the population genetic structure of sympatric psyllid populations associated with different non-crop hosts.

Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85,p<10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4,p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56,p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis.

In South Africa, the species is categorized as an emerging or incipient weed used as fodder, timber, firewood and in erosion control on degraded habitats. The species is common along the eastern subtropical regions of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, where it invades grasslands, savannas and edges of forests. Soils of these ecosystems are characterized as nutrient deficient and acidic. Using a pot trial, we determined the effects of the nutrient addition treatments on microbial symbiosis, N nutrition and biomass accumulation of L. leucocephala under greenhouse conditions. After 180 days of growth, plants were harvested, and their utilization of N derived from the atmosphere and from the soil was quantified through determination of delta15N values. L. leucocephala maintained growth and N nutrition by relying on both atmospheric- and soil-derived N across all soil treatments. The NDFA was significantly higher in high P (N1 + P, N2 + P and N3 + P) soils. L. leucocephala was able to nodulate with intermediate and fast-growing strains from the Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium genus in N2 + P grown plants. This shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring nutrients, especially in nutrient limited conditions, by establishing plant symbiosis with multiple bacteria and relying on extracting N from the soil and from the atmosphere through the symbiosis.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,2223-7747,,,MEDLINE:34834605,34834605,

One way to assess a population's disease burden is to determine the seroprevalence of pathogens of interest. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of 11 zoonotic pathogens in people living in Alaska. Methods: In a 2007 avian influenza exposure study, we recruited persons with varying wild bird exposures. Using sera from this study, we tested for antibodies to Cryptosporidium spp., Echinococcus spp., Giardia intestinalis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella spp., Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, California serogroup bunyaviruses, and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Results: Eight hundred eighty-seven persons had sera tested, including 454 subsistence bird hunters and family members, 160 sport bird hunters, 77 avian wildlife biologists, and 196 persons with no wild bird exposure. A subset (n=481) of sera was tested for California serogroup bunyaviruses. We detected antibodies to 10/11 pathogens. Seropositivity to Cryptosporidium spp. (29%), California serotype bunyaviruses (27%), and G. intestinalis (19%) was the most common; 63% (301/481) of sera had antibodies to at least one pathogen. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, Cryptosporidium spp. seropositivity was higher in females (35.7% vs. 25.0%; p=0.01) and G. intestinalis seropositivity was higher in males (21.8% vs. 15.5%; p=0.02). Alaska Native persons were more likely than non-Native persons to be seropositive to C. burnetii (11.7% vs. 3.8%; p=0.005) and less likely to be seropositive to HEV (0.4% vs. 4.1%; p=0.01). Seropositivity to Cryptosporidium spp., C. burnetii, HEV, and Echinococcus granulosus was associated with increasing age (p≤0.01 for all) as was seropositivity to ≥1 pathogen (p<0.0001).

In this study, we searched for a wide range of bacteria, protozoa and viruses in different organs of rodents from the town of Franceville in Gabon. Samples from one hundred and ninety-eight (198) small mammals captured, including two invasive rodent species, five native rodent species and 19 shrews belonging to the Soricidae family, were screened. The investigated pathogens were bacteria from the Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families, Mycoplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., Orientia spp., Occidentia spp., Leptospira spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Coxiella burnetii, and Yersinia pestis; parasites from class Kinetoplastida spp. (Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma spp.), Piroplasmidae spp., and Toxoplasma gondii; and viruses from Paramyxoviridae, Hantaviridae, Flaviviridae and Mammarenavirus spp. We identified the following pathogenic bacteria: Anaplasma spp. (8.1%; 16/198), Bartonella spp. (6.6%; 13/198), Coxiella spp. (5.1%; 10/198) and Leptospira spp. (3.5%; 7/198); and protozoans: Piroplasma sp.

These pathogens were found in Gabonese rodents, mainly Lophuromys sp., Lemniscomys striatus and Praomys sp. We also identified new genotypes: Candidatus Bartonella gabonensis and Uncultured Anaplasma spp. This study shows that rodents in Gabon harbor some human pathogenic bacteria and protozoans.

Biochemical carbon-concentrating mechanisms such as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which improves photosynthetic, water-use, and possibly nutrient-use efficiency, represent a strategic target for synthetic biology to engineer more productive C3 crops for a warmer and drier world. One key challenge for introducing multigene traits like CAM onto a background of C3 photosynthesis is to gain a better understanding of the dynamic spatial and temporal regulatory events that underpin photosynthetic metabolism. With the aid of systems and computational biology, vast amounts of experimental data encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be related in a network to create dynamic models. Such models can undergo simulations to discover key regulatory elements in metabolism and suggest strategic substitution or augmentation by synthetic components to improve photosynthetic performance and water-use efficiency in C3 crops. Another key challenge in the application of synthetic biology to photosynthesis research is to develop efficient systems for multigene assembly and stacking. Here, we review recent progress in computational modelling as applied to plant photosynthesis, with attention to the requirements for CAM, and recent advances in synthetic biology tool development.

In this study, SOR was introduced into a flowering plant Cornus canadensis to enhance its heat tolerance and reduce heat induced damage. A fusion construct of the SOR gene and Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP) was introduced into C. canadensis using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Heat tolerance of the GFP-SOR expressing transgenic plants was investigated by observing morphological symptoms of heat injury and by examining changes in photosynthesis, malondialdehyde (MDA), and proline levels in the plants. Our results indicate that the expression of the P. furiosus SOR gene in the transgenic plants alleviated lipid peroxidation of cell membranes and photoinhibition of PS II, and decreased the accumulation of proline at 40°C. After a series of exposures to increasing temperatures, the SOR transgenic plants remained healthy and green whereas most of the non-transgenic plants dried up and were unable to recover. While it had previously been reported that expression of SOR in Arabidopsis enhanced heat tolerance, this is the first report of the successful demonstration of improved heat tolerance in a non-model plant resulting from the introduction of P. furiosus SOR.

The Gram-negative bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti relies on its RSI (ExoR-ExoS-ChvI) Invasion Switch to turn on the production of succinoglycan, an exopolysaccharide required for its host invasion. Recent whole-genome sequencing efforts have uncovered putative components of RSI-like invasion switches in many other symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. To explore the possibility of the existence of a common invasion switch, we have conducted a phylogenomic survey of orthologous ExoR, ExoS, and ChvI tripartite sets in more than ninety proteobacterial genomes. Our analyses suggest that functional orthologs of the RSI invasion switch co-exist in Rhizobiales, an order characterized by numerous invasive species, but not in the order's close relatives. Phylogenomic analyses and reconstruction of orthologous sets of the three proteins in Alphaproteobacteria confirm Rhizobiales-specific gene synteny and congruent RSI evolutionary histories. Evolutionary analyses further revealed site-specific substitutions correlated specifically to either animal-bacteria or plant-bacteria associations. Lineage restricted conservation of any one specialized gene is in itself an indication of species adaptation. However, the orthologous phylogenetic co-occurrence of all interacting partners within this single signaling pathway strongly suggests that the development of the RSI switch was a key adaptive mechanism.

Information on putative risk factors was collected using standardized questionnaires. A logistic model with a binomial outcome was built to identify risk factors for being seropositive. The estimated true seroprevalence values were 18.1% (95% CI: 11-25.3) (cattle-only herds), 22.2% (95% CI: 16.5-28.8) (sheep flocks), 45.4% (95% CI: 30.3-61.6) (goat herds), 70.4% (95% CI: 55.5-84.9) (mixed sheep-goat flocks), 34.3% (95% CI: 28.4, 40.4) (all small ruminant flocks) and 38.5% (95% CI: 24.3-51.8) (mixed herds of cattle and small ruminants). Only 1.5% of small ruminant flocks were vaccinated. The seroprevalence was higher in northern areas, where livestock density is also higher. The logistic model fitted the data well and had a very high predictive ability. In the small ruminant model, five variables were significantly associated with a higher odds of seropositivity: lending/borrowing rams (OR=8.9, 95% CI: 3.0-26.1), feeding aborted material to dogs (OR=8.0, 95% CI: 3.5-18.1) the presence of goats (OR=6.9, 95% CI: 3.1-15.4), introducing new animals to the flock (OR=5.8, 95% CI: 2.5-13.6), and a large flock size (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.0-4.6). Conversely, separating newly introduced animals (OR=0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.47), separating animals that had aborted (OR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.46) and using disinfectants to clean pens (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.83) were significantly associated with a lower odds of being seropositive.

This requirement of multiple resistance genes to confer resistance to P. capsici, in chile makes breeding for resistance a daunting pursuit. Against this backdrop, a genetic engineering approach would be to introduce a broad host resistance gene into chile in order to protect it from different races of P. capsici. Notably, a broad host resistance gene RB from Solanum bulbocastanum has been shown to confer resistance to P. infestans in both S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum.

Doing so would further advance the mechanistic understanding of self-incompatibility in Brassicaceae. Therefore, we attempted to generate A. thaliana transformants showing the self-recognition activity of Brassica rapa by introducing BrSCR along with a chimeric BrSRK (BrSRK chimera, in which the kinase domain of BrSRK was replaced with that of AlSKR-b). We found that the BrSRK chimera and BrSCR of B. rapa S-9 and S-46 haplotypes, but not those of S-29, S-44, and S-60 haplotypes, conferred self-recognition activity in A. thaliana. Analyses of A. thaliana transformants expressing mutant variants of the BrSRK-9 chimera and BrSCR-9 revealed that mutations at the amino acid residues involved in BrSRK9-BrSCR9 interaction caused defects in the self-incompatibility response.

Commercial RAS must be allowed to equilibrate following installation, before fish can be introduced. There is little information available regarding the bacterial community structure in commercial zebrafish housing systems, or the time-point at which the system or biofilter reaches a microbiological equilibrium in RAS in general.METHODS: A zebrafish housing system was monitored at multiple different system sites including tank water in six different tanks, pre- and post-particulate filter water, the fluidized bed biofilter substrate, post-carbon filter water, and water leaving the ultra-violet (UV) disinfection unit and entering the tanks. All of these samples were collected in quadruplicate, from prior to population of the system with zebrafish through 18weeks post-population, and analyzed using both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and culture using multiple agars and annotation of isolates via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Sequencing data were analyzed using traditional methods, network analyses of longitudinal data, and integration of culture and sequence data.RESULTS: The water microbiome, dominated by Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus spp., reached a relatively stable richness and composition by approximately three to four weeks post-population, but continued to evolve in composition throughout the study duration. The microbiomes of the fluidized bed biofilter and water leaving the UV disinfection unit were distinct from water at all other sites. Core taxa detected using molecular methods comprised 36 amplicon sequence variants, 15 of which represented Proteobacteria including multiple members of the families Burkholderiaceae and Sphingomonadaceae. Culture-based screening yielded 36 distinct isolates, and showed moderate agreement with sequencing data.CONCLUSIONS: The microbiome of commercial RAS used for research zebrafish reaches a relatively stable state by four weeks post-population and would be expected to be suitable for experimental use following that time-point.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,,2524-4671,,MEDLINE:34353374,34353374,

The compact 3.1 kb triple reporter cassette can either be carried on a replicating plasmid or integrated into the genome avoiding artifacts associated with variation in copy number of plasmid-borne reporter constructs.

The T5-promoter served as a constitutive and homogeneously active control promoter indicating cell viability. wgeA promoter activity was heterogeneous over the whole period of colony development, whereas sinI promoter activity passed through a phase of heterogeneity before becoming homogeneous at late stages. Although quorum sensing-dependent regulation is a major factor activating galactoglucan production, activities of both promoters did not correlate at single cell level. We developed a novel mathematical strategy for classification of the gene expression status in cell populations based on the increase in fluorescence over time in each individual.

Homologs of the cps gene are commonly found in the genomes of most fungal and some bacterial pathogens. Afcps1/cpsA is important in sporulation, cell wall composition, and virulence. However, the precise regulation patterns of cell wall integrity by Afcps1/cpsA and further effects on the immune response are poorly understood. Specifically, our in-depth study revealed that Afcps1 affects cell-wall stability, showing an increased resistance of DeltaAfcps1 to the chitinmicrofibril destabilizing compound calcofluor white (CFW) and susceptibility of DeltaAfcps1 to the beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase inhibitor echinocandin caspofungin (CS). Additionally, deletion of Afcps2 had a normal sporulation phenotype but caused hypersensitivity to Na+ stress, CFW, and Congo red (CR). Specifically, quantitative analysis of cell wall composition using high-performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detector (HPAEC-PAD) analysis revealed that depletion of Afcps1 reduced cell wall glucan and chitin contents, which was consistent with the down-regulation of expression of the corresponding biosynthesis genes. Moreover, an elevated immune response stimulated by conidia of the DeltaAfcps1 mutant in marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) during phagocytosis was observed.

A specific LysM-type receptor kinase, LjEPR3 in Lotus japonicus and MtLYK10 in Medicago truncatula, was found to act in a secondary identity-based mechanism, controlling intracellular rhizobium infection. Furthermore, LjEPR3 showed to bind surface exopolysaccharides of Mesorhizobium loti, the diazotrophic microsymbiont of L. japonicus. EPR3 orthologous genes are not unique to legumes. Surprisingly, however, its ortholog EXOPOLYSACCHARIDE RECEPTOR (EPR) is pseudogenized in Parasponia, the only lineage of non-legume plants that nodulate also with rhizobium.RESULTS: Analysis of genome sequences showed that EPR3 orthologous genes are highly conserved in nodulating plants. We identified a conserved retrotransposon insertion in the EPR promoter region in three Parasponia species, which associates with defected transcriptional regulation of this gene. Subsequently, we studied the EPR gene of two Trema species as they represent the sister genus of Parasponia for which it is assumed it lost the nitrogen-fixing nodulation trait. Both Trema species possess apparently functional EPR genes that have a nodulation-specific expression profile when introduced into a Parasponia background. This indicates the EPR gene functioned in nodulation in the Parasponia-Trema ancestor.CONCLUSION: We conclude that nodule-specific expression of EPR3 orthologous genes is shared between the legume and Parasponia-Trema lineage, suggesting an ancestral function in the nitrogen-fixing nodulation trait. Pseudogenization of EPR in Parasponia is an exceptional case in nodulating plants. We speculate that this may have been instrumental to the microsymbiont switch -from Frankia to rhizobium- that has occurred in the Parasponia lineage and the evolution of a novel crack entry infection mechanism.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1471-2229,,MEDLINE:35490231,35490231,

They are widespread in nature and recovered from various biomes that may be explained by a high genetic diversity in this genus. Among the numerous metabolic properties they can harbor, the nitrogen fixation resulting from the association with plants among which important crop legumes (soya bean, peanut, cowpea ) is of great interest, notably in a context of sustainable development. Metabarcoding is widely applied to study biodiversity from complex microbial communities. Here, we demonstrate that using a new species-specific and highly polymorphic 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer barcode, we could rapidly estimate the diversity of bradyrhizobial populations that associate with cowpea and peanut plants, two crop legumes of major interest in Senegal. Application of the method on indigenous bradyrhizobia associated with peanut and cowpea grown in soils collected in the center of the peanut basin shows that Bradyrhizobium vignae is a dominant symbiont. We also showed that the two plant species associate with distinct community profiles and that strains introduced by inoculation significantly modified the population structure with these two plants suggesting that application of elite strains as inoculants may well ensure optimized symbiotic performance. This approach may further be used to study the diversity of bradyrhizobia from contrasting agro-eco-climatic zones, to test whether the plant genotype influences the association outputs as well as to estimate the competitiveness for nodule occupancy and the fate of elite strains inoculated in the field.Key points An amplicon sequencing approach targeting the Bradyrhizobium genus was developed.

The inoculation was carried out on the corn seeds sown in unsterilized Red Ferrallitic soil, at a rate of 300 μl of inoculum per seed. The experiment was established under controlled conditions of light, relative humidity, temperature and irrigation and it was determined: plant height, root length, aerial dry mass, root dry mass and concentration of total chlorophylls, 30 days after inoculation. The best results were obtained with treatments inoculated with Stenotrophomonas sp. INCA-FRr1, Stenotrophomonas sp. INCA-FRc24 and Rhizobium sp. INCA-FRc1.

Introducing ammonium high uptake aquatic plants and shifting nitrogen removal pathway from nitrate to nitrite in constructed wetlands (CWs) has been regarded as promising approach to promote their performances. This study aimed to establish nitrite pathway and enhance N removal via free nitrous acid (FNA)-sediment treatment and Myriophyllum aquaticum vegetation in the CWs treating anaerobically digested swine wastewater. Nitrite pathway was successfully and stably achieved in the M. aquaticum CW with FNA-treated sediment. The overall removal efficiencies of ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen were 42.3±10.2% and 37.7±9.3% in the planted CWs with FNA-treated sediment, which were 76.3% and 65.4% higher than those in the conventional oxidation pond system, respectively. Microbial community analysis (qPCR and metagenomics) suggested that the nitrite pathway established through FNA-sediment treatment was based on the inactivation of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (lower nxrA gene abundance) and the reduction of relative abundances of NOB (especially Nitrobacter and Nitrospira). During the denitrification processes, the integration of M. aquaticum vegetation with FNA-sediment treatment can lower the nitrate reduction by decreasing narG gene abundances and decreasing the relative abundances of napA affiliated bacteria (especially Bradyrhizobium), while strengthening reduction of nitrite and nitrous oxide by increasing nirK and nosZ gene abundances and enriching the corresponding affiliated microbial taxa, Mycobacterium and Bacillus, respectively.

However, crossbreeding is a labor-intensive process that requires between 5 and 7 years to develop a new variety. More recently, genome editing with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has been established as an efficient method to accelerate the breeding process by introducing targeted modifications to plant genomes via generation of targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs). CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to generate a variety of specific changes ranging from gene knockouts to gene replacements, and can also be easily multiplexed to modify several targets simultaneously. Given that (1) generating knockout mutations only requires a DSB that is frequently repaired by the error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway resulting in gene function inactivation, and (2) the genetic basis of many useful agronomic traits consists of loss of gene function, multiple traits can be created in a plant in one generation by simultaneously introducing DSBs into multiple genes of interest. On the other hand, more precise modifications, such as allele replacement, can be achieved by gene targeting-a less efficient process in which an external template is used to repair the DSB by homologous recombination (HR). These technical breakthroughs allow the design and customization of plant traits to achieve the ideal plant type (ideotype).

Among these, bacteriophage therapy, as well as the administration of specific bacteriolysis agents, i.e., lytic enzymes, have emerged as attractive alternatives. Nebulizers offer the possibility for delivering these therapeutics directly to the lung, which is particularly advantageous as a non-invasive and direct route to treat bacterial lung infections. Nevertheless, nebulizers can often result in significant degradation of the bacteriophage or protein, both structurally and functionally, due to the large stresses the aerosolization process imposes on these entities. In this work, we assess the capability of a novel low-cost and portable hybrid surface and bulk acoustic wave platform (HYDRA) to nebulize a Myoviridae bacteriophage (phage K) and lytic enzyme (lysostaphin) that specifically targets Staphylococcus aureus. Besides its efficiency in producing phage or protein-laden aerosols within the 1-5mum respirable range for optimum delivery to the lower respiratory tract where lung infections commonly take place, we observe that the HYDRA platform-owing to the efficiency of driving the aerosolization process at relatively low powers and high frequencies (approximately 10MHz)-does not result in appreciable denaturation of the phages or proteins, such that the loss of antimicrobial activity following nebulization is minimized. Specifically, a low (0.1 log10 (pfu/ml)) titer loss was obtained with the phages, resulting in a high viable respirable fraction of approximately 90%. Similarly, minimal loss of antimicrobial activity was obtained with lysostaphin upon nebulization wherein its minimum inhibitory concentration (0.5 mug/ml) remained unaltered as compared with the non-nebulized control. These results therefore demonstrate the potential of the HYDRA nebulization platform as a promising strategy for pulmonary administration of alternative antimicrobial agents to antibiotics for the treatment of lung diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,5,0,10,,,,1873-3441,,MEDLINE:32315699,32315699,

At least one infectious complication (IC) was diagnosed in 60 (52.6%) patients aged 0.1-17.7years, that is, 59.5% with SCID and 49.4% with non-SCID.RESULTS: Among 60 HSCT recipients diagnosed with at least one IC, 188 episodes of infectious complications (EIC) were recorded, that is, 46.8% of BI, 41.5% of VI, and 11.7% of proven/probable IFD. According to PID and HSCT donor type, the incidence of EIC was comparable (P=.679). The localization of infections differed significantly due to PID type (P=.002). After each HSCT donor type, the most common site of infection was GI. Overall, BI caused by Gram-positive strains (59.1%) were prevalent, especially Staphylococcaceae. The multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens were diagnosed in 52.3%, especially ESBL+Enterobacteriaceae. The profile of VI was comparable for SCID and non-SCID patients (P=.839). The incidence of IFD was comparable for each PID and HSCT donor type. Survival after infection was 91.5% and was comparable for PID and HSCT donor type.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of patients diagnosed with IC among pediatric PID-HSCT recipients did not depend on PID type, but rather on HSCT donor type. The localization of IC depended on PID and HSCT donor type. Within bacterial infections, predominated Gram-positive strains and the MDR pathogens were responsible for more than half of EIC.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,,1399-3038,,MEDLINE:32150770,32150770,

Merr) grown in the USA. Because of its significance as a microsymbiont of this economically important legume, B. elkanii USDA 76T was selected as part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute 2010 Genomic Encyclopedia for Bacteria and Archaea-Root Nodule Bacteria sequencing project. Here the symbiotic abilities of B. elkanii USDA 76T are described, together with its genome sequence information and annotation. The 9,484,767 bphigh-quality draft genome is arranged in 2 scaffolds of 25 contigs, containing 9060 protein-coding genes and 91 RNA-only encoding genes. The B. elkanii USDA 76T genome contains a low GC content region with symbiotic nod and fix genes, indicating the presence of a symbiotic island integration. A comparison of five B. elkanii genomes that formed a clique revealed that 356 of the 9060 protein coding genes of USDA 76T were unique, including 22 genes of an intact resident prophage. A conserved set of 7556 genes were also identified for this species, including genes encoding a general secretion pathway as well as type II, III, IV and VI secretion system proteins. The type III secretion system has previously been characterized as a host determinant for Rj and/or rj soybean cultivars. Here we show that the USDA 76T genome contains genes encoding all the type III secretion system components, including a translocon complex protein NopX required for the introduction of effector proteins into host cells. While many bradyrhizobial strains are unable to nodulate the soybean cultivar Clark (rj1), USDA 76T was able to elicit nodules on Clark (rj1), although in reduced numbers, when plants were grown in Leonard jars containing sand or vermiculite. In these conditions, we postulate that the presence of NopX allows USDA 76T to introduce various effector molecules into this host to enable nodulation.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,1944-3277,,,MEDLINE:28270909,28270909,

Analysis of the resultant transformants showed the random integration of T-DNA into the P.xanthii genome. The integrations were maintained in successive generations in the presence of selection pressure. Transformation was found to be transient, because in the absence of selection agent, the introduced genetic markers were lost due to excision of T-DNA from the genome.

Both organisms share identical pathway for trehalose biosynthesis (the TPS/TPP pathway), while a high degree of homology in their trehalose hydrolysis capacity (trehalase activities) has also been demonstrated. In the search for new, effective and environmentally sustainable compounds, a set of trehalase inhibitors has emerged as a potentially interesting antifungal and insecticidal target.

Cultured isolates from lung sputum reveal high inter- and intraindividual variability in pathogen strains, sequence variants, and phenotypes; disease progression likely depends on the precise combination of infecting lineages. Routine clinical protocols, however, provide a limited overview of the colonizer populations. Therefore, a more comprehensive and precise identification and characterization of infecting lineages could assist in making corresponding decisions on treatment. Here, we describe longitudinal tracking for four cystic fibrosis patients who exhibited extreme clinical phenotypes and, thus, were selected from a pilot cohort of 11 patients with repeated sampling for more than a year. Following metagenomics sequencing of lung sputum, we find that the taxonomic identity of individual colonizer lineages can be easily established. Crucially, even superficially clonal pathogens can be subdivided into multiple sublineages at the sequence level. By tracking individual allelic differences over time, an assembly-free clustering approach allows us to reconstruct multiple lineage-specific genomes with clear structural differences. Our study showcases a culture-independent shotgun metagenomics approach for longitudinal tracking of sublineage pathogen dynamics, opening up the possibility of using such methods to assist in monitoring disease progression through providing high-resolution routine characterization of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.IMPORTANCE Cystic fibrosis patients frequently suffer from recurring respiratory infections caused by colonizing pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Although modern therapies can sometimes alleviate respiratory symptoms by ameliorating residual function of the protein responsible for the disorder, management of chronic respiratory infections remains an issue. Here, we propose a minimally invasive and culture-independent method to monitor microbial lung content in patients with cystic fibrosis at minimal additional effort on the patient's part. Through repeated sampling and metagenomics sequencing of our selected cystic fibrosis patients, we successfully classify infecting bacterial lineages and deconvolute multiple lineage variants of the same species within a given patient.

This study analysed isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a species associated with nosocomial-acquired and community-acquired infections, from hospitals in Germany and Switzerland exhibiting a slight decrease in susceptibility to carbapenems.METHODS: E. coli strains from Germany and Switzerland, obtained mainly in 2019, were first screened for carbapenemase genes by PCR and subsequently whole-genome-sequenced and analysed for their clonal relationship using multilocus sequence typing, single nucleotide polymorphisms, virulence and antibiotic-resistance gene content.RESULTS: The analysis revealed the presence of extended beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli clones producing OXA-244, a point-mutation derivative of OXA-48, with a predominance of isolates exhibiting the sequence type (ST) ST38 in both Germany and Switzerland. These clustered exclusively into two distinct lineages: one encoding CTX-M-27, a recently emerged extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the other CTX-M-14b. All OXA244/CTX-M-27 ST38 isolates harboured the Dr adhesin operon and a representative isolate exhibited a diffuse adherence (DAEC) phenotype and was invasive for Hela cells.CONCLUSION: Clonal lineages of ST38 are members of E. coli phylogenetic group D commonly associated with extra-intestinal infections. Their increased isolation in two different European countries indicates ongoing spread of ST38 ESBL-producing and OXA-244-producing E. coli clonal lineages.

However, most of the root study methods have paid little attention to make and preserve whole root specimens. This study introduces root system sampling equipment that makes the entire root specimen with minimum impairment and without displacement of the spatial arrangement of the root system in root boxes. The objectives are to assess: whether the equipment can rapidly sample the entire root system; whether root surface area is measurable from a scanned digital image of the root specimen; and whether staining of the entire root specimens would provide multidimensional visual information on the interaction between soil and physiological function of root system architecture (RSA). For validation, we examined the root response of two soybean cultivars to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation and the effect of waterlogging stress on the physiological activity of buckwheat RSA.RESULTS: The root boxes allowed soybean and buckwheat plants to grow uniformly across the replications. Both species showed significant differences between cultivars and/or among treatments in shoot and root traits. The equipment enabled to sample the whole-root specimens of soybean and buckwheat, where the tips of the fine roots were alive (diameter <0.2mm). Also, the whole root specimens of soybean were made in about 7min. The root surface area calculated from the scanned soybean specimens showed a significant correlation with that calculated from the roots spread out in water (a common method). Staining of the soybean root specimens enabled us to observe the localized root proliferation induced by AM colonization. Moreover, staining of the buckwheat root specimens made it possible to examine the respiratory activity of each root at different depths.CONCLUSIONS: The present method realized: fast and accurate production of the whole root specimen and precise calculation of the specimens' root surface area.

Quorum quenching (QQ) via enzymatic inactivation of AHLs is a promising strategy to reduce bacterial infections and drug resistance. Herein, a thermostable AHL lactonase (AidB), which could degrade different AHLs, with or without a substitution of carbonyl or hydroxyl at the C-3 position, was identified from the soil bacterium Bosea sp. strain F3-2. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that AidB is an AHL lactonase that hydrolyzes the ester bond of the homoserine lactone (HSL) ring. AidB was thermostable in the range 30 to 80°C and showed maximum activity after preincubation at 60°C for 30min. The optimum temperature of AidB was 60°C, and the enzyme could be stably stored in double-distilled water (ddH2O) at 4°C or room temperature. AidB homologs were found only in Rhizobiales and Rhodospirillales of the Alphaproteobacteria AidB from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and AidB from Rhizobium multihospitium (with amino acid identities of 50.6% and 52.8% to AidB, respectively) also showed thermostable AHL degradation activity.

In this work, we identified a novel AHL lactonase, AidB, from a soil bacterial strain, Bosea sp. F3-2. The expression of aidB reduced the production of AHL signals and QS-dependent virulence factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pectobacterium carotovorum The homologs of AidB with AHL-degrading activities were found only in several genera belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria Remarkably, AidB is a thermostable enzyme that retained its catalytic activity after treatment at 80°C for 30min and exhibits reliable storage stability at both 4°C and room temperature.

One such restorer gene is Rfo, which restores fertility to the radish Ogura or ogu CMS. Rfo, like most characterized restorers, encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, a family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by tandem repeats of a 35 amino acid motif. While over 400 PPR genes are found in characterized plant genomes and the importance of this gene family in organelle gene expression is widely recognized, few detailed in vivo assessments of primary structure-function relationships in this protein family have been conducted.RESULTS: In contrast to earlier studies, which identified 16 or 17 PPR domains in the Rfo protein, we now find, using a more recently developed predictive tool, that Rfo has 18 repeat domains with the additional domain N-terminal to the others. Comparison of transcript sequences from pooled rfo/rfo plants with pooled Rfo/Rfo plants of a mapping population led to the identification of a non-restoring rfo allele with a 12 bp deletion in the fourth domain. Introduction into ogu CMS plants of a genetic construct in which this deletion had been introduced into Rfo led to a partial loss in the capacity to produce viable pollen, as assessed by vital staining, pollen germination and the capacity for seed production following pollination of CMS plants. The degree of viable pollen production among different transgenic plants roughly correlated with the copy number of the introduced gene and with the reduction of the levels of the ORF138 CMS-associated protein. All other constructs tested, including one in which only the C-terminal PPR repeat was deleted and another in which this repeat was replaced by the corresponding domain of the related, non-restoring gene, PPR-A, failed to result in any measure of fertility restoration.CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the additional PPR domain in Rfo indicates that the protein, apart from its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence, consists almost entirely of PPR repeats. The newly identified rfo allele carries the same 4 amino acid deletion as that found in the neighboring, related, non-restoring PPR gene, PPR-A. Introduction of this four amino acid deletion into a central domain the Rfo protein, however, only partially reduces its restoration capacity, even though this alteration might be expected to alter the spacing between the adjoining repeats. All other tested alterations, generated by deleting specific PPR repeats or exchanging repeats with corresponding domains of PPR-A, led to a complete loss of restorer function. Overall we demonstrate that introduction of targeted alterations of Rfo into ogu CMS plants provides a sensitive in vivo readout for analysis of the relationship between primary structure and biological function in this important family of plant proteins.",,,,,,,,,8,2,1,0,6,0,11,,,,1471-2229,,MEDLINE:25403785,25403785,

In fast-growing legume-nodulating rhizobia, such as the species in the family Rhizobiaceae, the symbiotic plasmid is the main genetic basis for nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, and is susceptible to horizontal gene transfer. To further understand the symbioses evolution in Rhizobiaceae, we analyzed the pan-genome of this family based on 92 genomes of type/reference strains and reconstructed its phylogeny using a phylogenomics approach. Intriguingly, although the genetic expansion that occurred in chromosomal regions was the main reason for the high proportion of low-frequency flexible gene families in the pan-genome, gene gain events associated with accessory plasmids introduced more genes into the genomes of nitrogen-fixing species. For symbiotic plasmids, although horizontal gene transfer frequently occurred, transfer may be impeded by, such as, the host's physical isolation and soil conditions, even among phylogenetically close species. During coevolution with leguminous hosts, the plasmid system, including accessory and symbiotic plasmids, may have evolved over a time span, and provided rhizobial species with the ability to adapt to various environmental conditions and helped them achieve nitrogen fixation.

Two L. albus varieties, Mekna and Lumen, were used to trap rhizobia in soil samples collected from 56 sites with high active lime contents (0-49%). Nodulation occurred in only 15 soils. The local variety, Mekna, developed significantly more root nodules and had a trapping capacity in more soils than the imported variety Lumen. A phylogenetic analysis based on the partial 16S-23S ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of three chromosomal housekeeping genes, recA, atpD and dnaK, showed that strains were affiliated to Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, and Neorhizobium, with large internal diversity, including separate lineages. Infectivity tests highlighted some nodulation specificity at the plant variety level, since the strains originating from Mekna could only nodulate this variety, while strains trapped in Lumen could nodulate both varieties. When inoculated, almost all strains resulted in a significant increase in plant shoot dry weight on L. albus. Although Agrobacterium sp. strains isolated from L. albus could nodulate and had a plant growth promoting effect, no nodA and nodC genes could be amplified. This is discussed together with the absence of bradyrhizobia and the general infrequency of L. albus-nodulating rhizobia in Tunisian soils.

The cross-taxa SSR primers revealed monomorphic bands with sizes within the expected range in all the Kersting's groundnut landraces. The results of the aligned nucleotide sequences revealed marked genetic variability among the landraces. Kersting's groundnut was found to be a low N2-fixer, with 28-45% of its N derived from fixation at Nyankpala and 15-29% at Savelugu.

The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers has become one of the major agronomic inputs in crop production systems. Strategies to enhance nitrogen assimilation and flux in planta are being pursued through the introduction of novel genetic alleles. Here an Agrobacterium-mediated approach was employed to introduce the alanine aminotransferase from barley (Hordeum vulgare), HvAlaAT, into wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), regulated by either constitutive or root preferred promoter elements. Plants harboring the transgenic HvAlaAT alleles displayed increased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity. The enhanced alt activity impacted height, tillering and significantly boosted vegetative biomass relative to controls in wheat evaluated under hydroponic conditions, where the phenotypic outcome across these parameters varied relative to time of year study was conducted. Constitutive expression of HvAlaAT translated to elevation in wheat grain yield under field conditions.

In this study, sonication followed by vacuum infiltration is shown to increase agroinfiltration-mediated GUS expression in soybean. Agroinfiltration, a valuable tool for rapid analysis of gene function, has been used extensively on leaf tissue of Nicotiana benthamiana and several other plant species. However, the application of this approach for gene functionality studies in soybean has been largely unsuccessful. Improvements in agroinfiltration of many plants have been achieved through a variety of approaches to allow better delivery, penetration and infection of Agrobacterium to interior leaf tissues. In this work, an agroinfiltration approach was developed for transient expression in soybean utilizing sonication followed by vacuum infiltration of intact seedlings. The optimal infiltration buffer, sonication time, and vacuum conditions for agroinfiltration of soybean were evaluated by monitoring expression of an introduced beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. The developed method included the use of an infiltration buffer (10mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 10mM MgCl2, 100M acetosyringone) supplemented with the reducing agent dithiothreitol, with 30s sonication followed by vacuum infiltration.

In this study, we present the first application of genome editing technology in cacao, using Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation to introduce CRISPR/Cas9 components into cacao leaves and cotyledon cells. As a first proof of concept, we targeted the cacao Non-Expressor of Pathogenesis-Related 3 (TcNPR3) gene, a suppressor of the defense response. After demonstrating activity of designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) in vitro, we used Agrobacterium to introduce a CRISPR/Cas9 system into leaf tissue, and identified the presence of deletions in 27% of TcNPR3 copies in the treated tissues. The edited tissue exhibited an increased resistance to infection with the cacao pathogen Phytophthora tropicalis and elevated expression of downstream defense genes. Analysis of off-target mutagenesis in sequences similar to sgRNA target sites using high-throughput sequencing did not reveal mutations above background sequencing error rates. These results confirm the function of NPR3 as a repressor of the cacao immune system and demonstrate the application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful functional genomics tool for cacao.

This percentage was then compared to that of two additional transformation protocols based on root explants in the R108 ecotype. Variations in embryonic tissue sources, media components, time for transformation, and vectors were analyzed.CONCLUSIONS: While no A17 transgenic plants were obtained, transgenic plantlets from the R108 ecotype were produced in as little as 4 months with a comparison of the two widely studied ecotypes under a single set of conditions. While the protocols tested gave similar results in percentage of transformed plants produced, considerations of labor and time to transgenics that vary between the root explant protocols tested were discovered.

Appressorium turgor, however, was not affected by deletion of SPF1. The co-localization of Spf1-GFP and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein, Lhs1-DsRed2, indicated that Spf1 is an ER-localized P5-ATPase. An ER stress factor, 0.5mug/ml tunicamycin (TUNI), inhibited the growth of ∆spf1, but another ER stress factor, 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT), promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Treatment with chemicals for oxidative stress (5mM H2O2 and 0.8mM paraquat) also promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Gene expression assays showed that unfolded protein response (UPR) components KAR2, OST1, PMT1, ERV29, PDI1, SCJ1, SEC61, a Ca2+ channel-related P-type ATPase gene PMR1, and a calcineurin-dependent transcription factor CRZ1 were significantly up-regulated in ∆spf1, suggesting activation of UPR in the mutant. These lines of experimental evidence indicate that SPF1 is involved in some basal ER mechanisms of P. oryzae including UPR pathway and responses to ER related stresses, therefore, affecting fungal development and virulence. However, the detailed mechanism between Spf1 and virulence still awaits future researches.",,,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,8,0,11,,,,1432-0983,,MEDLINE:31471638,31471638,

There seems to be an emerging dominance of pyogenic infections over tuberculosis and brucellosis.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study based on electronic case records of 4 years from a tertiary reference facility in Oman. Case records, microbiology reports, blood reports, imaging studies, and histopathology, and surgical reports of all spinal infection cases were studied. Patients with secondary infections after invasive spinal interventions and expatriate patients were excluded. Risk factors and comorbidities were also analyzed.RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of primary spondylodiscitis of the spine were identified in this cohort, including 10 cases of tuberculosis, 1 of brucellosis, and 1 of tuberculosis with pyogenic infection. Of the 50 pyogenic infections, 4 were in children; among the adults, the mean age was 49.5 years and 63.8% were male. Thirty-three patients had no medical comorbidities. Common ailments associated were 18 patients with diabetes mellitus, 13 hypertensives, 6 with renal insufficiency, 2 with liver cirrhosis, 3 with alcoholism, 5 with hepatitis C virus, and 2 with immunosuppression. More than 69% involvement was in the lumbar spine. Fourteen patients were infected with Staphylococcus aureus and 9 with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas 35.4% were culture negative.CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous infective spondylodiscitis affects older men with and without medical comorbidities equally. It often involves the lumbar spine and a third of patients are culture negative.

During predation, myxobacterial cells produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes to kill and consume the prey. It is known that eukaryotic predators, such as ameba and macrophages, introduce copper and other metals into the phagosomes to kill their prey by oxidative stress. However, the role of metals in bacterial predation has not yet been established. In this work, we have addressed the role of copper during predation of M. xanthus on Sinorhizobium meliloti. The use of biosensors, variable pressure scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X ray analysis has revealed that copper accumulates in the region where predator and prey collide. This accumulation of metal up-regulates the expression of several mechanisms involved in copper detoxification in the predator (the P1 B-ATPase CopA, the multicopper oxidase CuoA and the tripartite pump Cus2), and the production by the prey of copper-inducible melanin, which is a polymer with the ability to protect cells from oxidative stress. We have identified two genes in S. meliloti (encoding a tyrosinase and a multicopper oxidase) that participate in the biosynthesis of melanin. Analysis of prey survivability in the co-culture of M. xanthus and a mutant of S. meliloti in which the two genes involved in melanin biosynthesis have been deleted has revealed that this mutant is more sensitive to predation than the wild-type strain. These results indicate that copper plays a role in bacterial predation and that melanin is used by the prey to defend itself from the predator. Taking into consideration that S. meliloti is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium in symbiosis with legumes that coexists in soils with M. xanthus and that copper is a common metal found in this habitat as a consequence of several human activities, these results provide clear evidence that the accumulation of this metal in the soil may influence the microbial ecosystems by affecting bacterial predatory activities.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:32117124,32117124,

Modern agriculture is facing a pressing situation where novel strategies must be developed for sustainable food production and security. Biostimulants, conceptually defined as non-nutrient substances or microorganisms with the ability to promote plant growth and health, represent the potential to provide sustainable and economically favorable solutions that could introduce novel approaches to improve agricultural practices and crop productivity. Current knowledge and phenotypic observations suggest that biostimulants potentially function in regulating and modifying physiological processes in plants to promote growth, alleviate stresses, and improve quality and yield. However, to successfully develop novel biostimulant-based formulations and programs, understanding biostimulant-plant interactions, at molecular, cellular and physiological levels, is a prerequisite. Metabolomics, a multidisciplinary omics science, offers unique opportunities to predictively decode the mode of action of biostimulants on crop plants, and identify signatory markers of biostimulant action. Thus, this review intends to highlight the current scientific efforts and knowledge gaps in biostimulant research and industry, in context of plant growth promotion and stress responses. The review firstly revisits models that have been elucidated to describe the molecular machinery employed by plants in coping with environmental stresses. Furthermore, current definitions, claims and applications of plant biostimulants are pointed out, also indicating the lack of biological basis to accurately postulate the mechanisms of action of plant biostimulants. The review articulates briefly key aspects in the metabolomics workflow and the (potential) applications of this multidisciplinary omics science in the biostimulant industry.",,,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,21,0,41,,,2218-1989,,,MEDLINE:33321781,33321781,

However, a few well-infected nodules can be found on a commercial soybean using inocula containing a mixed pool of Tn5 insertion mutants derived from an incompatible strain. Reverse genetics and genome sequencing of compatible mutants demonstrated that inactivation of T3SS (type three secretion system) accounted for this phenotypic change. These mutations in the T3SS gene cluster were dominated by parallel transpositions of insertion sequences (ISs) other than the introduced Tn5. This genetic and phenotypic change can also be achieved in an experimental evolution scenario on a laboratory time scale using incompatible wild-type strains as inocula. The ISs acting in the adaptive evolution of Sinorhizobium strains exhibit broader phyletic and replicon distributions than other ISs, and prefer target sequences of low GC% content, a characteristic feature of symbiosis plasmid where T3SS genes are located.

MD simulations showed that residues W34, F37, and S188 of DehE were crucial for substrate binding. DehE showed strong binding ability for D-2-chloropropionic acid (D-2CP) and L-2-chloropropionic acid (L-2CP) but less affinity for 3CP. This reduced affinity was attributed to weak hydrogen bonding between 3CP and residue S188, as the carboxylate of 3CP forms rapidly interconverting hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide and side chain hydroxyl group of S188. By replacing S188 with a valine residue, we reduced the inter-molecular distance and stabilised bonding of the carboxylate of 3CP to hydrogens of the substrate-binding residues. Therefore, the S188V can act on 3CP, although its affinity is less strong than for D-2CP and L-2CP as assessed by Km.

Bacteria introduced in field soils rarely compete well with indigenous bacteria, including mutated lines selected for high nitrogen fixation capacity.

This review highlights that the primary regulation of N2 fixation is a result of response of integrated physiological activity at the plant level. Nitrogen feedback from the host plant plays an important role in regulating the N2 fixation rate. Rapid sequestration of fixed nitrogen by the plant is especially important for high N2 fixation activity. In addition, water cycling in the plant between the shoot and nodules plays a key role in sustaining high N2 fixation activity.

In transgenic T0 plants, pPE2-generated mutants occurred with 0%-31.3% frequency, suggesting that the efficiency of pPE2 varied greatly at different genomic sites and with prime-editing guide RNAs of diverse structures. To optimize editing efficiency, guide RNAs were introduced into the pPE2 system following the PE3 and PE3b strategy in human cells. However, at the genomic sites tested in this study, pPE3 systems generated only comparable or even lower editing frequencies. Furthemore, we developed a surrogate pPE2 system by incorporating the HPT-ATG reporter to enrich the prime-edited cells. The nucleotide editing was easily detected in the resistant calli transformed with the surrogate pPE2 system, presumably due to the enhanced screening efficiency of edited cells.

Microbial communities in the fog at both sites were diverse, distinct from clear aerosols, and influenced by both soil and marine sources. Fog from both sites contained Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, commonly soil- and air-associated phyla, but also contained bacterial taxa associated with marine environments including Cyanobacteria, Oceanospirillales, Novosphingobium, Pseudoalteromonas, and Bradyrhizobiaceae. Marine influence on fog communities was greatest near the coast, but still evident in Namib fogs 50 km inland.

Assay of the SorT Mo centre catalytic competency in the absence of SorU showed that substitutions in the central arginine (R78Q, R78K and R78M mutations) only moderately altered SorT catalytic properties, except for R78M which caused significant reduction in SorT activity. The substitutions also altered the Mo-centre redox potentials (MoVI/V potential lowered by ca. 60-80mV). However, all Arg78 mutations significantly impaired the ability of SorT to transfer electrons to SorU, where activities were reduced 17 to 46-fold compared to SorTWT, precluding determination of kinetic parameters. This was accompanied by the observation of conformational changes in both the introduced Gln and Lys residues in the crystal structure of the enzymes. Taking into account data collected by others on related SOE mutations we propose that the formation and maintenance of an electron transfer complex between the Mo centre and electron accepting heme groups is the main function of the central arginine, and that the reduced turnover and increases in KMsulfite are caused by the inefficient operation of the oxidative half reaction of the catalytic cycle in enzymes carrying these mutations.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,0005-2728,,,MEDLINE:28986298,28986298,

A low surface loading of SO42- promoted Cr(VI) reduction. The Cr(VI) removal percentage increased from 60 to 70% when the SO42- loading increased from 0 to 4.7mgSO42-/m2-d. After the SO42- loading decreased back to zero, the Cr(VI) removal further increased to 90%, suggesting that some sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) stayed in the reactor to reduce Cr(VI). However, a high surface loading of SO42- (26.6mgSO42-/m2-d) significantly slowed down the Cr(VI) reduction to 40% removal, which was probably due to competition between Cr(VI) and SO42- reduction. Similarly, when 0.5mg/L of Se(VI) was introduced into the MBfR, Cr(VI) removal percentage slightly decreased to 60% and then increased to 80% when input Se(VI) was removed again. The microbial community strongly depended on the loadings of Cr(VI) and SO42-. In the sulfate effect experiment, three genera were dominant. Based on the correlation between the abundances of the three genera and the loadings of Cr(VI) and SO42-, we conclude that Methylocystis, a type II methanotroph, reduced both Cr(VI) and sulfate, Meiothermus only reduced Cr(VI), and Ferruginibacter only reduced SO42-.",,,,,,,,,17,2,0,0,16,0,19,,,,1614-7499,,MEDLINE:29255986,29255986,

RC1 that catalyses the specific cleavage of halide ion from L-2-halocarboxylic acids to produce the corresponding D-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids. Recently, the catalytic residues of DehL have been identified and its catalytic mechanism has been fully elucidated. However, the enantiospecificity determinants of the enzyme remain unclear.

The highest seed yield was obtained with early sown crop (10th April) during both years. Pod formation reduced with increasing atmospheric temperature and no pods were formed on the plants sown on 30th June. Decreased pod formation seemed a major reason for low yield in late-sown crop. The highest yield was observed for the crop sown on 10th April, which was decreased by 40% for the crop sown on 1st May.

However, antibody DNA sequences can be introduced into plants, and together with laboratory technologies that allow the design of antibodies recognizing any conceivable molecular structure, plants can be used as 'green factories' to produce any antibody at all. The advent of plant-based transient expression systems in particular allows the rapid, convenient, and safe production of antibodies, ranging from laboratory-scale expression to industrial-scale manufacturing. The key features of plant-based production include safety, speed, low cost, and convenience, allowing newcomers to rapidly master the technology and use it to its full advantage. Manufacturing in plants has recently achieved significant milestones and offers more than just an alternative to established microbial and mammalian cell platforms. The use of plants for product development in particular offers the power and flexibility to easily coexpress many different genes, allowing the plug-and-play construction of novel bionanomaterials, perfectly complementing existing approaches based on plant virus-like particles.

Using SC-PCR, we found that single-copy T-DNA integrations were more frequent in transgenic T1 Arabidopsis without a vector backbone. On the basis of this phenomenon, we combined the negative screen of the vector backbone and SC-PCR to efficiently identify single-copy T-DNA plants. We found that T-DNA copy number detection was underestimated in transgenic plants containing inverted T-DNA repeats due to hairpin structures formed during PCR, indicating that PCR-based methods for detecting T-DNA copy number should be reevaluated. We solved this problem by releasing T-DNA from the complex structures using restriction enzymes before performing SC-PCR.

The main objective of this study was to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels, to ensure better targeting of animal health resources. A second objective was to investigate whether the targeted surveillance programmes resulting from this rationalized approach would also benefit the local communities engaged in livestock production. A multi-criteria prioritization process was developed, involving local experts, to score and rank 132 animal diseases based on their priority at the regional and national levels for four PICTs: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which form part of a regional Food Animal Biosecurity Network. In parallel interviews with farmers and field animal health and production workers were conducted to assess their perception of animal diseases. The list of the top-twenty ranked diseases for the Pacific Islands region shows a mix of endemic zoonotic diseases (such as leptospirosis ranked first; brucellosis third; tuberculosis sixth; and endoparasites and ectoparasites, respectively eleventh and thirteenth) with exotic diseases (such as HPAI ranked second, FMD fifth, and rabies ninth). There were different disease ranking lists for each of the four targeted PICTs, confirming different strategies of disease prevention and control may be required for each country, rather than a regional approach. Interviewed animal health and production workers were unfamiliar with most of the prioritized diseases and a majority acknowledged that they would not be able to recognize clinical signs if outbreaks were to occur in their area. Leptospirosis, which is endemic and identified as the top priority disease at the regional level, was never mentioned by any interviewed farmer. Farmers did not name any emerging infectious diseases as priorities. Instead, they identified endemic diseases (parasites, flu, coccidiosis, and scabies) as the most important. While animal disease priorities appear to differ widely between the targeted regions and countries, it also varies significantly between experts and farmers. Better targeted surveillance programmes may thus result in more rational and transparent allocation of resources, and thus enhanced food security, but may not directly match the needs of the local communities.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,12,0,14,,,,1873-6254,,MEDLINE:25572609,25572609,

Three heterologous genes, including the standard scientific reporter uid that codes for beta-glucuronidase and two genes of interest: ctb coding for cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), and hIL-13 coding for human interleukin 13, were independently introduced into alfalfa via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Somatic embryos were subsequently induced from transgenic plants carrying these genes. Somatic embryos accumulated approximately twofold more recombinant proteins than vegetative organs including roots, stems, and leaves. The recombinant proteins of CTB and hIL-13 accumulated up to 0.15 and 0.18 % of total soluble protein in alfalfa somatic embryos, respectively. The recombinant proteins expressed in somatic embryos also exhibited biological activities.

Decreased TK activity decreased the photosynthetic rate, seed germination rate, growth yield, and the tolerance to low temperature and weak light stress. Transketolase (TK, EC 2.2.1.1) is a key enzyme in the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle (Calvin cycle). A cDNA fragment (526 bp) encoding transketolase was cloned from cucumber plants (Cucumis sativa L. cv 'Jinyou 3') by RT-PCR. The antisense expression [(PBI-CsTK(-)] vector containing the CsTK gene fragment was constructed. The resulting plasmid was introduced into the cucumber inbred lines '08-1' using the agrobacterium-mediated method, and four antisense transgenic cucumber plants were obtained. Decreased CsTK expression either unaltered or slightly increased the mRNA abundance and activities of the other main enzymes in the Calvin cycle, however, it decreased the TK activity and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in antisense transgenic cucumber leaves. Antisense plants showed decreases in the growth, ratio of female flowers and yield compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. The decrease in Pn, stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (PhiPSII) and the increase in electrolyte leakage (EL) were greater in antisense transgenic plants than in WT plants under low temperature (5 °C) and low light intensity (100 mumol m(-2) s(-1)).",,,,,,,,,23,2,0,0,18,0,25,,,,1432-203X,,MEDLINE:25471346,25471346,

The widespread invasiveness of the psyllid vector and HLB in citrus trees worldwide has underscored the need for non-traditional approaches to manage the disease. One tenable solution is through the deployment of RNA interference technology to silence protein-protein interactions essential for ACP-mediated CLas invasion and transmission. To identify psyllid interactor-bacterial effector combinations associated with psyllid-CLas interactions, cDNA libraries were constructed from CLas-infected and CLas-free ACP adults and nymphs, and analyzed for differential expression.

To ensure the early detection of any brucellosis outbreak, event-driven surveillance relies on the mandatory notification of bovine abortions and the brucellosis testing of aborting cows. However, the under-reporting of abortions appears frequent. Our objectives were to assess the aptitude of the bovine abortion surveillance system to detect each and every bovine abortion and to identify factors influencing the system's effectiveness. We evaluated five attributes defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control with a method suited to each attribute: (1) data quality was studied quantitatively and qualitatively, as this factor considerably influences data analysis and results; (2) sensitivity and representativeness were estimated using a unilist capture-recapture approach to quantify the surveillance system's effectiveness; (3) acceptability and simplicity were studied through qualitative interviews of actors in the field, given that the surveillance system relies heavily on abortion notifications by farmers and veterinarians. Our analysis showed that (1) data quality was generally satisfactory even though some errors might be due to actors' lack of awareness of the need to collect accurate data; (2) from 2006 to 2011, the mean annual sensitivity - i.e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion out of all those who detected such events - was around 34%, but was significantly higher in dairy than beef cattle herds (highlighting a lack of representativeness); (3) overall, the system's low sensitivity was related to its low acceptability and lack of simplicity. This study showed that, in contrast to policy-makers, most farmers and veterinarians perceived the risk of a brucellosis outbreak as negligible. They did not consider sporadic abortions as a suspected case of brucellosis and usually reported abortions only to identify their cause rather than to reject brucellosis. The system proved too complex, especially for beef cattle farmers, as they may fail to detect aborting cows at pasture or have difficulties catching them for sampling. By investigating critical attributes, our evaluation highlighted the surveillance system's strengths and needed improvements. We believe our comprehensive approach can be used to assess other event-driven surveillance systems. In addition, some of our recommendations on increasing the effectiveness of event-driven brucellosis surveillance may be useful in improving the notification rate for suspected cases of other exotic diseases.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,,1873-1716,,MEDLINE:25748002,25748002,

The results indicated that CLas isolates in the newly invaded area (Pingshan) were more diverse than those in the HLB endemic areas (Leibo and Ningnan). Phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial genomes demonstrated that ACPs in Leibo, Pingshan, and Xuzhou (rural areas) represent a new mitochondrial group (MG4), distinguished by the three unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms in cox1, nad4, and cytb. However, the ACPs sampled from the urban areas of Cuiping and Xuzhou belonged to the southeastern China group (MG2-1).

To find rhizobia associated with Anthyllis at a given site, we evaluated the genetic and phenotypic properties of a collection of 137 rhizobia recovered from soils presenting contrasting metal levels. Zn-Pb mine soils largely contained metal-tolerant rhizobia belonging to Mesorhizobium metallidurans or to another sister metal-tolerant species. All of the metal-tolerant isolates harbored the cadA marker gene (encoding a metal-efflux PIB-type ATPase transporter). In contrast, metal-sensitive strains were taxonomically distinct from metal-tolerant populations and consisted of new Mesorhizobium genospecies. Based on the symbiotic nodA marker, the populations comprise two symbiovar assemblages (potentially related to Anthyllis or Lotus host preferences) according to soil geographic locations but independently of metal content. Multivariate analysis showed that soil Pb and Cd concentrations differentially impacted the rhizobial communities and that a rhizobial community found in one geographically distant site was highly divergent from the others. In conclusion, heavy metal levels in soils drive the taxonomic composition of Anthyllis-associated rhizobial populations according to their metal-tolerance phenotype but not their symbiotic nodA diversity. In addition to heavy metals, local soil physicochemical and topoclimatic conditions also impact the rhizobial beta diversity. Mesorhizobium communities were locally adapted and site specific, and their use is recommended for the success of phytostabilization strategies based on Mesorhizobium-legume vegetation.IMPORTANCE: Phytostabilization of toxic mine spoils limits heavy metal dispersion and environmental pollution by establishing a sustainable plant cover. This eco-friendly method is facilitated by the use of selected and adapted cover crop legumes living in symbiosis with rhizobia that can stimulate plant growth naturally through biological nitrogen fixation. We studied microsymbiont partners of a metal-tolerant legume, Anthyllis vulneraria, which is tolerant to very highly metal-polluted soils in mining and nonmining sites. Site-specific rhizobial communities were linked to taxonomic composition and metal tolerance capacity. The rhizobial species Mesorhizobium metallidurans was dominant in all Zn-Pb mines but one. It was not detected in unpolluted sites where other distinct Mesorhizobium species occur. Given the different soil conditions at the respective mining sites, including their heavy-metal contamination, revegetation strategies based on rhizobia adapting to local conditions are more likely to succeed over the long term compared to strategies based on introducing less-well-adapted strains.",,,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,15,0,16,,,,1098-5336,,MEDLINE:27793823,27793823,

Additionally, a small hydrophilic molecule, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF), was loaded into the PCL microchamber arrays in a dry state; however, the substantial permeability of the PCL film led to leakage of the dye molecules.

Production of PPTfrom natural ginseng plants requires artificial deglycosylation procedures of ginsenosides via enzymatic or physicochemical treatments. Metabolic engineering could be an efficient technology for production of ginsenoside sapogenin. For PPT biosynthesis in Panax ginseng, damarenediol-II synthase (PgDDS) and two cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP716A47 and CYP716A53v2) are essentially required.METHODS: Transgenic tobacco co-overexpressing P.ginseng PgDDS, CYP716A47, and CYP716A53v2 was constructed via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.RESULTS: Expression of the three introduced genes in transgenic tobacco lines was confirmed by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Analysis of liquid chromatography showed three new peaks, dammarenediol-II (DD), protopanaxadiol (PPD), and PPT, in leaves of transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco (line 6) contained 2.8mug/g dry weight (DW), 7.3mug/g DW, and 11.6mug/g DW of PPT, PPD, and DD in leaves, respectively. Production of PPT was achieved via cell suspension culture and was highly affected by auxin treatment. The content of PPT in cell suspension was increased 37.25-fold compared with that of leaves of the transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco was not able to set seeds because of microspore degeneration in anthers. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that cells of phloem tissue situated in the center of the anther showed an abnormally condensed nuclei and degenerated mitochondria.CONCLUSION: We successfully achieved the production of PPT in transgenic tobacco. The possible factors deriving male sterility in transgenic tobacco are discussed.",,,,,,,,,1,4,0,0,1,0,5,,,1226-8453,,,MEDLINE:30976164,30976164,

Root growth, O2 uptake, flux of carbon between sucrose and CO2 , levels of reactive oxygen species and some tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were positively correlated with levels of NDPK1 expression. In addition, NDPK1 levels positively affected UDP-glucose and cellulose contents. The activation state of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, a key enzyme in starch synthesis, was higher in antisense roots than in roots overexpressing NDPK1. Further analyses demonstrated that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was more oxidized, and therefore less active, in sense clones than antisense clones. Consequently, antisense NDPK1 roots accumulated more starch and the starch to cellulose ratio was negatively affected by the level of NDPK1.

The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and analysed using qiime ver. 1.8.

We developed a digital PCR-based GMO quantification method to evaluate the GMO content in maize grains. To minimize the analytical workload, we adopted multiplex digital PCR targeting the 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator, which are genetic elements commonly introduced in many GMOs.RESULTS: Our method is significantly simpler and more precise than the conventional real-time PCR-based methods.

The R1-nj marker is commonly used in doubled haploid breeding and has improved the efficiency of haploid identification. However, its effectiveness is limited by genetic background and environmental factors. We addressed this technical challenge by developing an efficient and accurate haploid embryo identification marker through co-expression of two transcription factor genes (ZmC1 and ZmR2) driven by the embryo-aleurone-specific bidirectional promoter PZmBD1 ; these factors can activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in the embryo and aleurone layer during early seed development. We developed a new haploid inducer, Maize Anthocyanin Gene InduCer 1 (MAGIC1), by introducing the transgenes into the haploid inducer line CAU6. MAGIC1 could identify haploids at 12days after pollination, which is nine days earlier than CAU6. Importantly, MAGIC1 increased haploid identification accuracy to 99.1%, compared with 88.3% for CAU6. In addition, MAGIC1 could effectively overcome the inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis in some germplasms. Furthermore, an upgraded anthocyanin marker was developed from ZmC1 and ZmR2 to generate MAGIC2, which could identify haploids from diploids due to differential anthocyanin accumulation in immature embryos, coleoptiles, sheaths, roots, leaves, and dry seeds. This haploid identification system is more efficient and accurate than the conventional R1-nj-based method, and it simplifies the haploid identification process.

No significant differences in root length or root biomass were observed between transgenic and non-transgenic plants under non-stress conditions. When subjected to gradual water deficit, transgenic plants maintained higher relative water content because the transgenic lines used water more slowly as a result of reduced total leaf area.

Transgenic plants showed differential drought tolerance responses with a significantly higher survival rate compared to non-transgenic plants when subjected to comparable severe water-deficit conditions. Moreover, the transgenic plants also showed improved drought tolerance by maintaining 17-24 % greater leaf cell membrane stability compared to non-transgenic plants. The results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering soybean for enhanced drought tolerance by expressing stress-responsive genes.",,,,,,,,,43,3,0,0,36,0,45,,,,1573-4978,,MEDLINE:25192890,25192890,

Furthermore, the P171F substitution identified in a strong OsALS1 allele was quickly introduced into the commercial rice cultivar Nangeng 46 through precise base editing with the corresponding base editor and sgRNA.

Reduced LlPDS expression and the detection of small interfering LlPDS RNA indicated that the color changes were the result of LlPDS gene silencing. In addition, the leaves also exhibited a mild photo-bleaching phenotype in the following year.

Currently, molecular, serological, and microbiological methods are used for diagnosis of this disease. In this study we examined ELISA, PCR and serum agglutination (SAT) methods on human patient serum samples.METHODS: A total of 100 serum samples were collected from suspected patients. Fifty serum samples gave a positive result with the Wright test. The ELISA method was first employed on all samples for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against Brucella. Subsequently, the rapid PCR methodology was used to identify presence of Brucella genome in 500 L of each serum sample. The B4/B5 primer pair was used for PCR amplification.RESULTS: Out of the 100 serum samples obtained from patients with suspected brucellosis, 50 samples tested positive by SAT and displayed high titers of 1/160. Of these 50 positive samples, 49 samples were positive as per the ELISA test whereas one sample tested negative. The PCR test was conducted on all 100 serum samples and results showed that the 45 serum samples that gave a positive agglutination test were also positive by PCR.CONCLUSIONS: Various laboratory methods have been used or introduced for the detection of Brucella.

We investigated the ability of CobT to act on either of two nitrogen atoms within a single, asymmetric benzimidazole substrate to form two isomeric riboside phosphate products. Reactions containing asymmetric benzimidazoles as substrates for homologues of CobT from different bacteria resulted in the production of distinct ratios of two isomeric products, with some CobT homologues favoring the production of a single isomer and others forming a mixture of products. These preferences were reflected in the production of cobamide isomers with lower ligands attached in different orientations, some of which are novel cobamides that have not been characterized previously. Two isomers of methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide were found to be unequal in their ability to support ethanolamine ammonia-lyase dependent growth in Salmonella enterica, suggesting that CobT's regiospecificity could be biologically important. We also observed differences in pKa, which can influence the reactivity of the cofactor and could contribute to these distinct biological activities.

Comparing the two types of soil, without soybean history and with 1-4 years SCI, we found out that plants grown in soil with soybean history and without inoculation had significantly more root nodules and higher nitrogen content in the plant tissue. These parameters, along with the leghemoglobin content, were found to be a variable among soils with 1-4 years SCI and did not show a trend over the years. Inoculation in soil without soybean history showed a significant increase in a nodulation rate, leghemoglobin content, and soybean tissue nitrogen concentration. The study found that response to inoculation varied significantly as per locations in soil with previous soybean cultivation history. An inoculated soybean grown on loamy sandy soils from the location Muncheberg had significantly more nodules as well as higher green tissue nitrogen concentration compared with non-inoculated plants. No significant improvement in a nodulation rate and tissue nitrogen concentration was observed for an inoculated soybean grown on loamy sandy soils from the location Fehrow. These results suggest that introduced SNB strains remained viable in the soil and were still symbiotically competent for up to 4 years after soybean cultivation. However, the symbiotic performance of the SNB remaining in the soils was not sufficient in all cases and makes inoculation with commercial products necessary. The SNB strains found in the soil of Central Europe could also be promising candidates for the development of inoculants and already represent a contribution to the successful cultivation of soybeans in Central Europe.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,0,4,,,1664-462X,,,MEDLINE:34149745,34149745,

Detached leaves from ScALDH21-overexpressing tobacco plants showed less water loss than those from nontransgenic plants. When subjected to drought and salt stress, transgenic plants displayed higher germination ratios, higher root lengths, greater fresh weight, higher proline accumulation, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and stronger photosynthetic capacities, as well as higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, compared with control plants.

However, the direct genetic evidence about the CsSUN-mediated regulation of fruit shape is still scarce, limiting our mechanistic understanding of the biological functions of CsSUN. Here, we introduced CsSUN into the round-fruited tomato inbred line 'SN1' (wild type, WT) via the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method. The high and constitutive expression of CsSUN was revealed by real-time PCR in all the tested tissues of the transgenic plants, especially in the fruits and ovaries. Phenotypic analyses showed that the ectopic expression of CsSUN increased fruit length while it decreased fruit diameter, thus leading to the enhanced fruit shape index in the transgenic tomato lines relative to the WT. Additionally, the reduction in the seed size and seed-setting rate and the stimulation of seed germination were observed in the CsSUN-expressed tomato. A histological survey demonstrated that the elongated fruits were mainly derived from the significant increasing of the longitudinal cell number, which compensated for the negative effects of decreased cell area in the central columellae. These observations are different from action mode of SlSUN, thus shedding new insights into the SUN-mediated regulation of fruit shape.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1422-0067,,MEDLINE:36077369,36077369,

In recent years, genome-editing via the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system for targeted genome modifications has emerged as the most powerful method due to the ease in designing and construction of gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) vectors. These sgRNA vectors are easily reprogrammable to direct Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) to generate double stranded breaks (DSBs) in the target genomes that are then repaired by the cell via the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway or by precise homologous recombination (HR) pathway. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been successfully implemented in potato for targeted mutagenesis to generate knockout mutations (by means of NHEJ) as well as gene targeting to edit an endogenous gene (by HR).

Microbial synthesis of eriodictyol has been attracting increasing attention due to several benefits. In this study, we employed a GRAS strain Corynebacterium glutamicum as the host to produce eriodictyol directly from tyrosine.RESULTS: We firstly optimized the biosynthetic module of naringenin, the upstream intermediate for eriodictyol production, through screening of different gene orthologues. Next, to improve the level of the precursor malonyl-CoA necessary for naringenin production, we introduced matB and matC from Rhizobium trifolii into C. glutamicum to convert extracellular malonate to intracellular malonyl-CoA. This combinatorial engineering resulted in around 35-fold increase in naringenin production from tyrosine compared to the initial recombinant C. glutamicum. Subsequently, the hpaBC genes from E. coli encoding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase were expressed in C. glutamicum to synthesize eriodictyol from naringenin. Further optimization of the biotransformation process parameters led to the production of 14.10mg/L eriodictyol.CONCLUSIONS: The biosynthesis of the ortho-hydroxylated flavonoid eriodictyol in C. glutamicum was achieved for the first time via functional expression of E. coli hpaBC, providing a baseline strain for biosynthesis of other complex flavonoids.

MtZIP6 (Medtr4g083570) is an M.truncatula Zinc-Iron Permease (ZIP) that is expressed only in roots and nodules, with the highest expression levels in the infection/differentiation zone. Immunolocalization studies indicate that it is located in the plasma membrane of nodule rhizobia-infected cells. Down-regulating MtZIP6 expression levels with RNAi does not result in any strong phenotype when plants are fed mineral nitrogen. However, these plants displayed severe growth defects when they depended on nitrogen fixed by their nodules, losing of 80% of their nitrogenase activity. The reduction of this activity was likely an indirect effect of zinc being retained in the infection/differentiation zone and not reaching the cytosol of rhizobia-infected cells.

Here we demonstrate that ArsH is an organoarsenical oxidase that detoxifies trivalent methylated and aromatic arsenicals by oxidation to pentavalent species. Escherichia coli, which does not have an arsH gene, is very sensitive to the trivalent forms of the herbicide monosodium methylarsenate [MSMA or MAs(V)] and antimicrobial growth promoter roxarsone [Rox(V)], as well as to phenylarsenite [PhAs(III), also called phenylarsine oxide or PAO]. Pseudomonas putida has two chromosomally encoded arsH genes and is highly resistant to the trivalent forms of these organoarsenicals. A derivative of P. putida with both arsH genes deleted is sensitive to MAs(III), PhAs(III) or Rox(III). P.putida arsH expressed in E.coli conferred resistance to each trivalent organoarsenical.

In the present study, we developed a technique to capture DNA-associated proteins called reverse chromatin immunoprecipitation (R-ChIP). This technology uses a set of specific DNA probes labeled with biotin to isolate chromatin, and the DNA-associated proteins are then identified using mass spectrometry. Using R-ChIP, we identified 439 proteinsthat potentially bind to the promoter of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene AtCAT3 (AT1G20620). According to functional annotation, we randomly selected 5transcription factors from these candidates, includingbZIP1664, TEM1, bHLH106, BTF3, and HAT1, to verify whether they in fact bind to the AtCAT3 promoter. The binding of these 5 transcription factors was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative real-time PCR andelectrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, we improved the R-ChIP method using plants in which the DNA of interest had been transiently introduced, which does not require the T-DNA integration, and showed that this substantially improved the protein capture efficiency.

First, a transcriptional analysis of a constitutive and an inducible HSP70 genes was conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana. Then the coding sequence of the inducible form was cloned and introduced into alfalfa by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and the accumulation of the protein in leaf tissue of transgenic plants was demonstrated. We also tested diverse alfalfa varieties for heat-inducible expression of endogenous HSP70, revealing variety-specific responses to heat shock.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,9,0,12,,,,1932-6203,,MEDLINE:25951604,25951604,

A comprehensive understanding of the assembly of the seed microbiome during seed development and maturation, the fate of microbes during storage, and the migration of microbes during seedling growth are still lacking. In this study, to understand the assembly and fate of endogenous bacteria in rice seeds from the ripening stage to the storage and seedling stages, we employed culture-dependent and metagenomic analyses. Bacterial communities in rice seeds were composed of a few dominant taxa that were introduced at the milky and dough stages, and they persisted during seed maturation. The culturable bacterial population gradually increased during the ripening stage, whereas there was a gradual decrease during storage. Bacteria that persisted during storage proliferated after imbibition and were distributed and established in the shoots and roots of rice seedlings. The storage temperature influenced the abundance of bacteria, which consequently changed the bacterial composition in the shoots and roots of seedlings. Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Allorhizobium were consistently abundant from seed development to the germination stage. Some endogenous bacterial strains significantly promoted the growth of Arabidopsis and rice plants. Overall, our results indicate that rice seeds are colonized by a few bacterial taxa during seed development, and their relative abundance fluctuates during storage and contributes significantly to the establishment of endophytes in the stems and roots of rice plants. The selected bacterial isolates can be used to improve the growth and health of rice plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the dynamics of bacterial populations during storage of rice seeds at different temperatures.

However, here we show that, when using such methods to reconstruct phylogenies from sets of simulated sequences, both the exclusion of nonpolymorphic positions and the alignment to a single reference genome, introduce systematic biases and errors in phylogeny reconstruction. To address these problems, we developed a new method that combines alignments from mappings to multiple reference sequences and show that this successfully removes biases from the reconstructed phylogenies.

Horizontal gene transfer from unrelated organisms has occurred in the course of plant evolution, suggesting that some foreign genes may be useful to plants. The CtHSR1 gene, previously isolated from the halophytic yeast Candida tropicalis, encodes a heat-shock transcription factor-related protein. CtHSR1, with expression driven by its own promoter or by the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter, was introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and the resulting transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought than controls. Fusions of the CtHSR1 promoter with beta-glucuronidase reporter gene indicated that this fungal promoter drives expression to phloem tissues. A chimera of CtHSR1 and green fluorescence protein is localized at the cell nucleus. The physiological mechanism of drought tolerance in transgenic plants is based on reduced transpiration (which correlates with decreased opening of stomata and increased levels of jasmonic acid) and increased osmotic potential (which correlates with increased proline accumulation). Transcriptomic analysis indicates that the CtHSR1 transgenic plants overexpressed a hundred of genes, including many relevant to stress defense such as LOX4 (involved in jasmonic acid synthesis) and P5CS1 (involved in proline biosynthesis). The promoters of the induced genes were enriched in upstream activating sequences for water stress induction.

Guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting two locations in the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene were either driven by the Arabidopsis U6-26 promoter (pC-PDS1) or assembled as a Csy4 array under the control of the CmYLCV promoter (pC-PDS2). All transgenic embryos were completely albino and no variegated phenotype was observed. We evaluated 12 lines from each construct in this study and the majority contain either insertion (1-2bp), substitution (1bp), or deletion (1-3bp) mutations that occurred close to the protospacer adjacent motif.CONCLUSIONS: Both the pC-PDS1 and pC-PDS2 could successfully edit the citrus embryogenic cell cultures.

For HR donor with the tobacco acetolactate synthase gene, SuRB, T-DNA1 contained DeltaSuRBW568L, which lacked the N-terminus region of SuRB and was created by three nucleotide substitutions (ATG to GCT; W568L), leading to herbicide chlorsulfuron (Cs) resistance, flanked by the hygromycin (Hm)-resistant gene. T-DNA2 consisted of the hSpCas9 gene and two gRNA inserts targeting SuRB and An2. For the 2nd HR donor with the tobacco An2 gene encoding a MYB transcription factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, T-DNA3 had a 35S promoter-driven An2 gene lacking the 3rd exon resulting in anthocyanin accumulation after successful HR. After selecting for Hm and Cs resistance from among the 7462 Agrobacterium-inoculated explants, 77 independent lines were obtained. Among them, the ATG to GCT substitution of endogenous SuRB was detected in eight T1-T2-derived lines and two T1-T2-T3-derived lines. Of these mutations, four T1-T2-derived lines were bi-allelic. All the HR events occurred across the endogenous SuRB and 5' homology arm of the randomly integrated T-DNA1. HR of the SuRB paralog, SuRA, was also found in one of the T1-T2-derived lines.

Strong reduction in both SBE isoforms created an extreme starch phenotype, as reported previously for low-SBE potato tubers. HPLC-SEC and 1 H NMR revealed a decrease in short amylopectin chains, an increase in long chains and a large reduction in branching frequency relative to wild-type starch. Mutants with strong reductions in SBE2 protein alone had near-normal amylopectin chain-length distributions and only small reductions in branching frequency.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has developed into a dedicated bioenergy crop. To improve the biomass production of switchgrass grown on different types of soil, abiotic stress tolerance traits are considered for its genetic improvement. Proline accumulation is a widespread response when plants are subjected to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and salinity. In plants, P5CS gene encodes the key regulatory enzyme that plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis. Here, we introduced the PuP5CS gene (from Puccinellia chinampoensis) into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic lines overexpressing the PuP5CS gene showed phenotypic advantages, in leaf width, internode diameter, internode length, tiller numbers and precocious flowering under normal conditions, and the transgenic lines displayed better regenerative capacity in forming more tillers after harvest. Moreover, the PuP5CS gene enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic switchgrass by altering a wide range of physiological responses. In accordance with the physiological results, histological analysis of cross sections through the leaf blade showed that the areas of bulliform cells and bundle sheath cells were significantly increased in PuP5CS-overexpressing leaves. The expression levels of ROS scavenging-associated genes in transgenic plants were higher than in control plants under salt stress.

To circumvent this, it has been proposed to implement the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), principally consisting of bicarbonate transporters and carboxysomes, into plant chloroplasts. As it is currently not possible to recover homoplasmic transplastomic monocots, foreign genes must be introduced in these plants via nuclear transformation. Consequently, it is paramount to ensure that resulting proteins reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment, which for cyanobacterial transporters BicA and SbtA, is the chloroplast inner-envelope membrane (IEM). At present, targeting signals to redirect large transmembrane proteins from non-chloroplastic organisms to plant chloroplast envelopes are unknown. The goal of this study was to identify such signals, using agrobacteria-mediated transient expression and confocal microscopy to determine the sub-cellular localization of 37 GFP-tagged chimeras. Initially, fragments of chloroplast proteins known to target soluble cargos to the stroma were tested for their ability to redirect BicA, but they proved ineffective. Next, different N-terminal regions from Arabidopsis IEM transporters were tested. We demonstrated that the N-terminus of AtHP59, AtPLGG1 or AtNTT1 (92-115 amino acids), containing a cleavable chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) and a membrane protein leader (MPL), was sufficient to redirect BicA or SbtA to the chloroplast envelope. This constitutes the first evidence that nuclear-encoded transmembrane proteins from non-chloroplastic organisms can be targeted to the envelope of plant chloroplasts; a finding which represents an important advance in chloroplast engineering by opening up the door to further manipulation of the chloroplastic envelope.",,,,,,,,,37,1,0,0,36,0,38,,,1664-462X,,,MEDLINE:26973659,26973659,

Holotrichia parallela (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidae), commonly known as the dark black chafer, is a troublesome pest of soybean (Glycine max). To test whether cry8-like can confer resistance against H. parallela to soybean, we introduced cry8-like from the Bt strain HBF-18 into soybean cultivar Jinong 28.RESULTS: Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that cry8-like was expressed most highly in soybean leaves. In addition, Southern blot assays revealed that one copy of the integrated fragment was present in the transformed plants. Eight independent cry8-like transgenic lines were subsequently fed on by H. parallela. Under H. parallela feeding stress, the survival rates of the non-transgenic plants were 92% lower than those of the transgenic plants. The mortality rate of H. parallela increased when the larvae fed on the roots of T1 transgenic soybean plants. Moreover, the surviving larvae were deformed, and their growth was inhibited.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest that transgenic soybean plants expressing the cry8-like gene are more resistant to H. parallela than non-transgenic plants and that transgenic expression of the cry8-like gene may represent a promising strategy for engineering pest tolerance.

SHP, a class III plant peroxidase, is derived from multiple sources. It has several advantages, such as high resistance to heat, high stability under acidic and alkaline conditions, and a broad substrate range. SHP is speculated to be useful for lignin degradation.

Functional prediction analysis showed that metabolism and environmental information processing were the dominant KEGG pathways at level 1. Our study showed that there were significantly different level 2 and 3 KEGG pathways in the midgut microbiota (16 level 2 and 24 level 3) and the entire bodies (33 level 2 and 248 level 3) between female Aedes albopictus and Aedes Aegypti.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings that Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus reared in the same laboratory harbor a similar gut bacterial microbiome but different entire body microbiota imply that the gut microbiota of adult mosquitoes is environmentally determined regardless of the host genotype, but the entire body microbiota is more genetically determined.

As a result, the outcome of plant competition can change with the density of mutualists, with microbe-responsive plant species having high competitive ability when mutualists are abundant and non-responsive plants having high competitive ability with low densities of mutualists. When responsive plant species also allow mutualists to grow to greater densities, changes in mutualist density can generate a positive feedback, reinforcing an initial advantage to either plant type. We study a model of mutualist-mediated competition to understand outcomes of plant-plant interactions within a patchy environment. We find that a microbe-responsive plant can exclude a non-responsive plant from some initial conditions, but it must do so across the landscape including in the microbe-free areas where it is a poorer competitor. Otherwise, the non-responsive plant will persist in both mutualist-free and mutualist-rich regions. We apply our general findings to two different biological scenarios: invasion of a non-responsive plant into an established microbe-responsive native population, and successional replacement of non-responders by microbe-responsive species. We find that resistance to invasion is greatest when seed dispersal by the native plant is modest and dispersal by the invader is greater. Nonetheless, a native plant that relies on microbial mutualists for competitive dominance may be particularly vulnerable to invasion because any disturbance that temporarily reduces its density or that of the mutualist creates a window for a non-responsive invader to establish dominance. We further find that the positive feedbacks from associations with beneficial soil microbes create resistance to successional turnover. Our theoretical results constitute an important first step toward developing a general understanding of the interplay between mutualism and competition in patchy landscapes, and generate qualitative predictions that may be tested in future empirical studies.",,,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,22,0,22,,,,1932-6203,,MEDLINE:25946068,25946068,

Rhizobia genomes usually harbor several plasmids which can be transferred to other organisms by conjugation. Two main mechanisms of the regulation of rhizobial plasmid transfer have been described: quorum sensing (QS) and the rctA/rctB system. Nevertheless, new genes and molecules that modulate conjugative transfer have recently been described, demonstrating that new actors can tightly regulate the process. In this work, by means of bioinformatics tools and molecular biology approaches, two hypothetical genes are identified as playing key roles in conjugative transfer. These genes are located between conjugative genes of plasmid pRfaLPU83a from Rhizobium favelukesii LPU83, a plasmid that shows a conjugative transfer behavior depending on the genomic background. One of the two mentioned genes, rcgA, is essential for conjugation, while the other, rcgR, acts as an inhibitor of the process. In addition to introducing this new regulatory system, we show evidence of the functions of these genes in different genomic backgrounds and confirm that homologous proteins from non-closely related organisms have the same functions. These findings set up the basis for a new regulatory circuit of the conjugative transfer of plasmids. IMPORTANCE Extrachromosomal DNA elements, such as plasmids, allow for the adaptation of bacteria to new environments by conferring new determinants. Via conjugation, plasmids can be transferred between members of the same bacterial species, different species, or even to organisms belonging to a different kingdom. Knowledge about the regulatory systems of plasmid conjugative transfer is key in understanding the dynamics of their dissemination in the environment. As the increasing availability of genomes raises the number of predicted proteins with unknown functions, deeper experimental procedures help to elucidate the roles of these determinants.

Using RACE technique, the full-length Egyptian-M6PR gene (1333bp) was cloned into pRI-201AN plant expression vector. Analysis of the cloned gene revealed that both American and Egyptian clones had both start and stop codons in frame and was found to be 930 base long. The newly cloned EM6PR gene was found to be 126 base longer than its American counterpart at the non-coding region. Six differences at nucleotide level between the Egyptian and American sequences were observed, three of which in the coding region resulting in three polymorphic amino acids differences (tryptophan vs. leucine, glutamine vs. histidine and isoleucine vs. leucine). The newly cloned gene was introduced to tobacco via Agrobacterium and PCR analysis of T0 plants indicated the presence of the EM6PR gene into 10 out of 38 tobacco individuals. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of EM6PR transcripts in 9 out of the 10 PCR positive plants. GC/MS analysis of some RT positive individuals indicated the accumulation of mannitol in transgenics tobacco, while mannitol was absent in non-transgenic controls.",,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,2,0,3,,,2190-572X,,,MEDLINE:28955638,28955638,

Here, we found that these alkenes have mainly omega-7 and omega-9 double bonds in characteristically long hydrocarbon chains ranging from C33 to C37. A screening of desaturase-deficient mutants showed that a single desaturase belonging to the acyl-CoA desaturase (ADS) family, previously reported as ADS4.2, was responsible for introducing double bonds en route to the wax alkenes. ADS4.2 was highly expressed in young leaves, especially in trichomes, where the alkenes are known to accumulate. The enzyme showed strong activity on acyl substrates longer than C32 and omega-7 product regio-specificity when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Its endoplasmic reticulum localization further confirmed that ADS4.2 has access to very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates. The upstream biosynthesis pathways providing substrates to ADS4.2 and the downstream reactions forming the alkene products in Arabidopsis were further clarified by alkene analysis of mutants deficient in other wax biosynthesis genes. Overall, our results show that Arabidopsis produces wax alkenes through a unique elongation-desaturation pathway, which requires the participation of ADS4.2.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,,1532-2548,,MEDLINE:33890667,33890667,

Plasmid pTiEU6 is comprised of 176,375bp with an overall GC content of 56.1% and 195 putative protein-coding sequences could be identified. This Ti-plasmid is most closely related to nopaline-type Ti-plasmids. It contains a single T-region which is somewhat smaller than that of the nopaline-type Ti-plasmids and in which the gene for nopaline synthesis is replaced by a gene (sus) for succinamopine synthesis.

Here, we found that MtGSTF7, a homolog of AtTT19, is essential for anthocyanin accumulation but not required for PA accumulation in Medicago truncatula. MtGSTF7 was induced by the anthocyanin regulator LEGUME ANTHOCYANIN PRODUCTION 1 (LAP1), and its tissue expression pattern correlated with anthocyanin deposition in M. truncatula. Tnt1-insertional mutants of MtGSTF7 lost anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative organs, and introducing a genomic fragment of MtGSTF7 could complement the mutant phenotypes. Additionally, the accumulation of anthocyanins induced by LAP1 was significantly reduced in mtgstf7 mutants. Yeast-one-hybridization and dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that LAP1 could bind to the MtGSTF7 promoter to activate its expression. Ectopic expression of MtGSTF7 in tt19 mutants could rescue their anthocyanin deficiency, but not their PA defect. Furthermore, PA accumulation was not affected in the mtgstf7 mutants.

For a long time, it was not possible to use DSB induction for efficient genome engineering due to the lack of a means to target DSBs to specific sites. This limitation was overcome by development of modified meganucleases and synthetic DNA-binding domains. Domains derived from zinc-finger transcription factors or transcription activator-like effectors may be designed to recognize almost any DNA sequence. By fusing these domains to the endonuclease domains of a classII restriction enzyme, an active endonuclease dimer may be formed that introduces a site-specific DSB. Recent studies demonstrate that gene knockouts via non-homologous end joining or gene modification via homologous recombination are becoming routine in many plant species. By creating a single genomic DSB, complete knockout of a gene, sequence-specific integration of foreign DNA or subtle modification of individual amino acids in a specific protein domain may be achieved. The induction of two or more DSBs allows complex genomic rearrangements such as deletions, inversions or the exchange of chromosome arms. The potential for controlled genome engineering in plants is tremendous. The recently discovered RNA-based CRISPR/Cas system, a new tool to induce multiple DSBs, and sophisticated technical applications, such as the in planta gene targeting system, are further steps in this development. At present, the focus remains on engineering of single genes; in the future, engineering of whole genomes will become an option.",,,,,,,,,145,10,1,0,123,0,168,,,,1365-313X,,MEDLINE:24112784,24112784,

Although many locations require testing and euthanasia of positive dogs, current diagnosis is limited by the time required for seroconversion, for example, presence of B. canis-specific antibodies. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic ability of Brucella canis-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect B. canis in field samples prior to serological positivity for faster diagnosis and prevention of transmission within kennels or in households. Two kennels, one of which was located in the owner's home, were sampled following observation of suggestive clinical signs and positive serology of at least one dog. Specimens obtained were comparatively analysed via serology and qPCR analysis. 107 dogs were analysed for B. canis infection via qPCR: 105 via whole-blood samples, 65 via vaginal swab, six via urine and seven via genitourinary tract tissue taken at necropsy. Forty-five dogs were found to be infected with canine brucellosis via qPCR, of which 22 (48.89%) were seropositive. A statistically significant number (P = 0.0228) of qPCR-positive dogs, 5/25 (20.00%), seroconverted within a 30-day interval after initial serologic testing. As compared to serology, qPCR analysis of DNA from vaginal swabs had a sensitivity of 92.31% and specificity of 51.92%, and qPCR analysis of DNA from whole-blood samples had a sensitivity of 16.67% and specificity of 100%. B. canis outer membrane protein 25 DNA qPCR from non-invasive vaginal swab and urine samples provided early detection of B. canis infection in dogs prior to detection of antibodies.

The study evaluated the effect of Africa Biofortified Sorghum (ABS) genes from ABS event 188 on the vegetative and reproductive features of the F2 populations derived from crosses with Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii. Results: F1 populations were obtained from reciprocal crosses involving ABS event 188 and its null segregant with inbred weedy parents from S. bicolor subsp. drummondii. Four F2 populations and four parental populations were raised in RCBD with 4 replications in a confined field plot for two seasons. Vegetative and reproductive traits were evaluated. The vigour shown in the F2 populations from the reciprocal crosses involving ABS event 188 and S. bicolor subsp. drummondii was similar to that in the crosses involving the null segregant and S. bicolor subsp. drummondii. Differences in vegetative and reproductive parameters were observed between the parental controls and the F2 populations. Examination of the above and below ground vegetative biomass showed lack of novel weedy related features like rhizomes. Conclusions: Therefore, release of crops with ABS 188 transgenes into cropping systems is not likely to pose a risk of conferring additional adaptive advantage in the introgressing populations.

These changes in translation speed dramatically improved the solubility of two EHs of metagenomic origin in Escherichia coli. Conversely, the importance of transient attenuation for the folding, and consequently solubility, of EH was evidenced with a member of the EH family from Agrobacterium radiobacter, which partitions in the soluble fraction when expressed in E. coli. Synonymous substitutions of codons shaping the slow-transiting regions to fast-translating codons render this protein insoluble. Furthermore, we show that low protein yield can be enhanced by decreasing the free folding energy of the initial 5'-coding region, which can disrupt mRNA secondary structure and enhance ribosomal loading.

This forms an extended biotrophic interface enclosing an apoplastic compartment into which fungal effectors can be deployed to evade host detection. M. oryzae also forms a focal, plant membrane-rich structure, the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), that accumulates cytoplasmic effectors for translocation into host cells. Molecular decision-making processes integrating fungal growth and metabolism in host cells with interface function and dynamics are unknown. Here, we report unanticipated roles for the M. oryzae Target-of-Rapamycin (TOR) nutrient-signaling pathway in mediating plant-fungal biotrophic interface membrane integrity. Through a forward genetics screen for M. oryzae mutant strains resistant to the specific TOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin, we discovered IMP1 encoding a novel vacuolar protein required for membrane trafficking, V-ATPase assembly, organelle acidification and autophagy induction. During infection, Deltaimp1 deletants developed intracellular IH in the first infected rice cell following cuticle penetration. However, fluorescently labeled effector probes revealed that interface membrane integrity became compromised as biotrophy progressed, abolishing the BIC and releasing apoplastic effectors into host cytoplasm. Growth between rice cells was restricted. TOR-independent autophagy activation in Deltaimp1 deletants (following infection) remediated interface function and cell-to-cell growth. Autophagy inhibition in wild type (following infection) recapitulated Deltaimp1. In addition to vacuoles, Imp1GFP localized to IH membranes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest TOR-Imp1-autophagy branch signaling mediates membrane homeostasis to prevent catastrophic erosion of the biotrophic interface, thus facilitating fungal growth in living rice cells.

Floral transition is a key developmental stage in the annual growth cycle of perennial fruit trees that directly determines the fruit development in the subsequent stage. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)/TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) family is known to play a vital regulatory role in plant growth and flowering. In apple, the two TFL1-like genes (MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2) function as floral inhibitors; however, their mechanism of action is still largely unclear. This study aimed to functionally validate MdTFL1 and probe into its mechanism of action in apple. MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2 were expressed mainly in stem and apical buds of vegetative shoots, with little expression in flower buds and young fruit. Expression of MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2 rapidly decreased during floral induction. On the other hand, transgenic Arabidopsis, which ectopically expressed MdTFL1-1 or MdTFL1-2, flowered later than wild-type plants; demonstrating their in planta capability to function redundantly as flower repressors. Furthermore, we identified hundreds of novel interaction proteins of the two apple MdTFL1 proteins using yeast two-hybrid screens. Independent experiments for several proteins confirmed the yeast two-hybrid interactions. Among them, the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-Y subunit C (MdNF-YC2) functions as a promoter of flowering in Arabidopsis by activating LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) expression. MdFT1 showed a similar interaction pattern as MdTFL1, implying a possible antagonistic action in the regulation of flowering.

The possibility to access data by third parties is among the most important new introduced within the agreement.OBJECTIVES: Aim of the present report is to improve the know-how on cystic fibrosis (CF) through a better characterization of Italian patients. Furthermore, the present Report aims at improving the care of CF patient. In particular, the Report should contribute to the following objectives: * to analize medium- and long-term clinical and epidemiological trends of the disesase; * to identify the main health care needs at regional and national level in order to contribute to the healthcare programmes and to the distribution of resources; * to compare Italian data with international ones.DESIGN: Analyses and results described in the present Report are referred to patients in charge to the Italian National Referral and Support Centers for Cystic Fibrosis in the period 2015-2016. Data were sent by Centres by means of a specific software (Camilla, Ibis Informatica). Data underwent to a double quality control (QC): the first by NHI and the second at a European level (before the inclusion of the italian data within the European Cystic Fibrosis Registry). These QCs assure the completeness and the accuracy of data as well as their consistency with European core data. Finally, in 2017, an additional CQ was performed to further reduce the number of missing data and consequently improve the precision and the consistency in the nomenclature adopted for genetic mutations.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29 different CF Centres (referral, support, and Paediatric Hospital Bambino Geso) sent their data referred to 2015-2016 years to ICFR . Data regarding Sardinia (Southern Italy) are missing and those from Treviso (Veneto Region, Northern Italy) and Rovereto (Trentino-Alto Adige Region, Northern Italy) are sent through Verona CF Centre.RESULTS: The present Report has been organized into 10 sections. 1. Demography: estimated CF patients is 5,204 in 2015 and 5,362 in 2016; median age is 20.6 and 21.0, respectively. Prevalence is 8.6/100,000 residents in Italy in 2015 and 8.8 in 2016. Male percentage is 51.6% on average for 2015 and 2016; CF distribution showed higher frequency in patients aged from 7 to 35 years. The mean of patients aged more than 18 years is 56.5% on average in 2015 and 2016. 2. Diagnoses: most of the CF patients were diagnosed before 2 years of age (median value: 68%); a significant percentage of patients (median value: 13%) was diagnosed in adult age. 3. New diagnoses: new diagnoses were 169 in 2015 and 153 in 2016. Estimated incidence in 2015 was 1/4,176 living births in 2015 and 1/5,510 in 2016. 4. Genetics: 99.5% of patients underwent genetic analyses and in 96% of patients a mutation in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene was identified. [delta]508F was the most frequent mutation (44,7% in 2016). Furthermore, 16.0% and 3.4% of patients was characterized by the presence of at least one residual function mutation and gating, respectively. Finally, 21% of patients was a stop codons (class 1 mutation) carrier. 5. Lung function: FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first second) scores progressively decreased before adult age, in accordance with the natural history of the disease. FEV1% values in patients between 6 and 17 years of age is ≥70%; patients with a FEV1% value of 40% are less than 2% in the period 2015-2016. 6. Nutrition: most critical periods are during the first 6 months of life and during adolescence. Prevalence of malnourished male aged 12-17 years is constant in 2015-2016 and is always more than the prevalence observed in female. An increasing percentage of female patient with a suboptimal BMI value (35.5%) is observed among patients aged more than 18 years 7.COMPLICATIONS: it was estimated that, in 2016, hepatopathies without cirrhosis (17.7%) is the principal complications in patients aged less than 18 years; in patients aged more than 18 years the principal complication was due to hepatopathies without cirrhosis (29.5%) and diabetes (23.3%). 8. Transplantation: in 2015-2016, 74 patients were bipulmunary transplanted; age was comprised between 8 and 52 years, median age at transplantation was 29,6 years. Median waiting times for transplantation is estimated in 17 months (24 months in 2015 and 14 months in 2016). 9. Microbiology: analyses were referred to test performed in 2016. Percentage of adult patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is 52.1% compared to 15.2% of paediatric patients; Staphylococcus aureus infection is present in 53.2% of adult patients and 52.8% of paediatric ones; Burkholderia Cepacia complex is present almost exclusively in adult patients (4.3%); Nontuberculous mycobacteria is present in 1.2% and 0.4% of adult and paediatric patients, respectively; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection is present in the 6.1% of adult patients and 4.9 of paediatric patients. 10. Mortality: 102 patients (49 males and 53 females; median age 36.9 years in 2015 and 36.5 in 2016) died in 2015-2016 (transplanted patients are not included).CONCLUSIONS: The present Report shows that Italian CF population is growing (median age) and paediatric mortality is decreasing. A very low percentage of paediatric population is characterized by complication of pulmonary function; adult patients are characterized by an increase of age at death (more than 36 years of age in 2016).",,,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,0,14,,,1120-9763,,,MEDLINE:31370382,31370382,

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are import regulators of MAPK pathway in plants under drought condition. However, the critical role in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) drought resistance is not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of StMAPK11 under drought stress. The result of RT-qPCR for assay of StMAPKs expression demonstrated that 15 StMAPKs were differentially expressed in leaves, flowers, petioles, stamens, pistils, stems, stolons, roots, tubers and tuber peels of potato. StMAPKs was dynamically modulated by abiotic stresses and plant hormone treatments, and StMAPK11 was apparently up-regulated under drought conditions. Therefore, the vectors pCPB-StMAPK11 and pCPBI121-miRmapk11 for over-expression and down-regulation of StMAPK11 were constructed, respectively, and introduced into potato cultivar Atlantic. The result showed that StMAPK11 promoted potato growth under drought conditions, as well as the physiological activities evidenced by changes in SOD, CAT and POD activity and H2O2, proline and MDA content. StMAPK11 up-regulation intensified drought resistance of potato plant by elevating antioxidant activities and photosynthesis. Moreover, we consolidated the protective role of StMAPK11 in tobacco and Arabidopsis against drought stress.

Drought stress is one of the most important abiotic stress factors that influence soybean crop quality and yield. Therefore, the creation of drought-tolerant soybean germplasm resources through genetic engineering technology is effective in alleviating drought stress. FvC5SD is a type of C-5 sterol desaturase gene that is obtained from the edible fungus Flammulina velutipes. This gene has good tolerance to the effects of stresses, including drought and low temperature, in yeast cells and tomato. In this study, we introduced the FvC5SD gene into the soybean variety Shennong9 through the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of soybean to identify drought-tolerant transgenic soybean varieties. PCR, RT-PCR, and Southern blot analysis results showed that T-DNA was inserted into the soybean genome and stably inherited by the progeny. The ectopic expression of FvC5SD under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic soybean plants enhanced the plant's tolerance to dehydration and drought. Under drought conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive oxygen species and exhibited higher activities and expression levels of enzymes and cell than wild-type soybean. iTRAQ analysis of the comparative proteomics showed that some exogenous genes coding either functional or regulatory proteins were induced in the transgenic lines under drought stress. FvC5SD overexpression can serve as a direct and efficient target in improving drought tolerance in soybean and may be an important biotechnological strategy for trait improvement in soybean and other crops.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,,1432-203X,,MEDLINE:31144112,31144112,

New biotechnology-based breeding methods such as targeted genome editing methods are able to create custom-designed medicinal plants with different secondary metabolite profiles. For a long time, humans have used medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes and in food and other industries. Classical biotechnology techniques have been exploited in breeding medicinal plants. Now, it is time to apply faster biotechnology-based breeding methods (BBBMs) to these valuable plants. Assessment of the genetic diversity, conservation, proliferation, and overproduction are the main ways by which genetics and biotechnology can help to improve medicinal plants faster. Plant tissue culture (PTC) plays an important role as a platform to apply other BBBMs in medicinal plants. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation and artificial polyploidy induction are the main BBBMs that are directly dependent on PTC. Manageable regulation of endogens and/or transferred genes via engineered zinc-finger proteins or transcription activator-like effectors can help targeted manipulation of secondary metabolite pathways in medicinal plants. The next-generation sequencing techniques have great potential to study the genetic diversity of medicinal plants through restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technique and also to identify the genes and enzymes that are involved in the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites through precise transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq). The sequence-specific nucleases of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc-finger nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated (Cas) are the genome editing methods that can produce user-designed medicinal plants. These current targeted genome editing methods are able to manage plant synthetic biology and open new gates to medicinal plants to be introduced into appropriate industries.",,,,,,,,,41,1,0,0,22,1,42,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:30715560,30715560,

Identification of agronomically important genes is a critical step for crop breeding through biotechnology. Multiple approaches have been employed to identify new gene targets, including comprehensive screening platforms for gene discovery such as the over-expression of libraries of cDNA clones. In this study, random genomic fragments from plants were introduced into rice and screened for drought tolerance in a high-throughput manner with the aim of finding novel genetic elements not exclusively limited to coding sequences. To illustrate the power of this approach, genomic libraries were constructed from four grass species, and screening a total of 50,825 transgenic rice lines for drought tolerance resulted in the identification of 12 reproducibly efficacious fragments. Of the twelve, two were from the mitochondrial genome of signal grass and ten were from the nuclear genome of buffalo grass. Subsequent sequencing and analyses revealed that the ten fragments from buffalo grass carried a similar genetic element with no significant homology to any previously characterized gene. The deduced protein sequence was rich in acidic amino acid residues in the C-terminal half, and two of the glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal half were shown to play an important role in drought tolerance. The results demonstrate that an open-ended screening approach using random genomic fragments could discover trait genes distinct from gene discovery based on known pathways or biased toward coding sequence over-expression.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1432-2242,,MEDLINE:31980835,31980835,

We used tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a bipartite begomovirus, to address this issue. Most ToLCNDV isolates are not mechanically transmissible to their natural hosts. The ToLCNDV-OM isolate, originally identified from a diseased oriental melon plant, is mechanically transmissible, while the ToLCNDV-CB isolate, from a diseased cucumber plant, is not. Genetic swapping and pathological tests were performed to identify the molecular determinants involved in mechanical transmission. Various viral infectious clones were constructed and successfully introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana, oriental melon, and cucumber plants by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation. Mechanical transmissibility was assessed via direct rub inoculation with sap prepared from infected N.benthamiana. The presence or absence of viral DNA in plants was validated by PCR, Southern blotting, and in situ hybridization. The results reveal that mechanical transmissibility is associated with the movement protein (MP) of viralDNA-B in ToLCNDV-OM. However, the nuclear shuttle protein of DNA-B plays no role in mechanical transmission. Analyses of infectious clones carrying a single amino acid substitution reveal that the glutamateat amino acid position 19 of MP in ToLCNDV-OM is critical for mechanical transmissibility. The substitution of glutamate with glycine at this position in the MP of ToLCNDV-OM abolishes mechanical transmissibility. In contrast, the substitution of glycine with glutamate at the 19th amino acid position in the MP of ToLCNDV-CB enables mechanical transmission. This is the first time that a specific geminiviral movement protein has been identified as a determinant of mechanical transmissibility.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,1364-3703,,MEDLINE:32078762,32078762,

In order to develop capacity for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the tropical staple cassava (Manihot esculenta), the Phytoene desaturase (MePDS) gene was targeted in two cultivars using constructs carrying gRNAs targeting two sequences within MePDS exon 13. After Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into cassava cells, both constructs induced visible albino phenotypes within cotyledon-stage somatic embryos regenerating on selection medium and the plants regenerated therefrom. A total of 58 (cv. 60444) and 25 (cv. TME 204) plant lines were recovered, of which 38 plant lines (19 from each cultivar) were analyzed for mutagenesis. The frequency of plant lines showing albino phenotype was high, ranging from 90 to 100% in cv. TME 204. Observed albino phenotypes were comprised of full albinos devoid of green tissue and chimeras containing a mixture of white and green tissues. Sequence analysis revealed that 38/38 (100%) of the plant lines examined carried mutations at the targeted MePDS site, with insertions, deletions, and substitutions recorded. One putatively mono-allelic homozygous line (1/19) was found from cv. 60444, while 1 (1/19) and 4 (4/19) putatively bi-allelic homozygous lines were found in 60444 and TME204, respectively. The remaining plant lines, comprised mostly of the chimeras, were found to be putatively heterozygous. We observed minor (1 bp) nucleotide substitutions and or deletions upstream of the 5' and or downstream of the 3' targeted MePDS region. The data reported demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of cassava is highly efficient and relatively simple, generating multi-allelic mutations in both cultivars studied. Modification of MePDS described here generates visually detectable mutated events in a relatively short time frame of 6-8 weeks, and does not require sequencing to confirm editing at the target. It therefore provides a valuable platform to facilitate rapid assessment and optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome-editing technologies in cassava.",,,,,,,,,79,8,1,0,62,0,85,,,1664-462X,,,MEDLINE:29093724,29093724,

Open reading frames (ORFs) of PgLEAs range from 291bp (PgLEA1-1) to 945bp (PgLEA2-11) and distributed randomly among the seven chromosomes.

The ultra-structural studies showed that the thickness of secondary wall (S2 layer) of fibre had been decreased with non-homogenous lignin distribution in antisense lines, while sense lines showed an increase in S2 layer thickness. Maule color reaction revealed that syringyl lignin distribution in the xylem elements was increased in sense and decreased in antisense lines.

Its transcription levels in three transgenic tobacco lines, T0-7, T0-9, and T0-20, in the T0 generation were higher than those in wild-type tobacco plants. By analysing Western blots and ELISAs, three T0 generation transgenic tobacco lines also expressed recombinant CoOMT (rCoOMT) protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40kDa, and its contents ranged from 0.048mugmg-1 to 0.177mugmg-1. These data illustrated that the CoOMT transgene was expressed; thus, the rCoOMT protein synthesis efficiency increased significantly in comparison with that of the wild-type tobacco plants. The total alkaloid contents ranged from 2.12g100g-1 (of dry weight) to 3.88g100g-1 (of dry weight). The T0-20 plant had the highest total alkaloid content (3.88g100g-1 of dry weight), followed by the T0-7 line (2.75g100g-1 of dry weight). The total alkaloid contents of the CoOMT transgenic tobacco lines increased by approximately 1.09-1.83-fold compared to the wild-type tobacco plants.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the transformation and expression of the CoOMT gene in N. tabacum plants.

Here we show that Arabidopsis ATPS2 dually encodes plastidic and cytosolic ATPS isoforms, differentiating their subcellular localizations by initiating translation at AUG(Met1) to produce plastid-targeted ATPS2 pre-proteins or at AUG(Met52) or AUG(Met58) within the transit peptide to have ATPS2 stay in cytosol.

The influenza virus is one of the main viral agents that generate pandemic outbreaks. Currently, the majority of co-circulating influenza A virus (IAV) strains are adamantine- and oseltamivir-resistant strains, and the challenge is to find new antivirals for more efficient treatments. The antiviral entry blocker (EB) peptide is a promising candidate for blocking the virus entry into cells. The aim of this research was to express the EB peptide in the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and test its antiviral activity against IAV in vitro. The EB peptide nucleotide sequence was introduced into the nuclear genome of microalgae using Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation. The EB peptide amount produced in transformed microalgae was 4.99 ± 0.067% of the total soluble protein. In hemagglutination inhibition assays using influenza A/H1N1 pdm and influenza A H1N1/Virginia/ATCC/2009 strains, we reported that the EB peptide extract from the microalgae showed 100-fold higher efficiency than the EB synthetic peptide. In addition, both the EB peptide extract and synthetic peptide inhibited viral replication in MDCK cells (IC50 = 20.7 nM and IC50 = 754.4 nM, respectively); however, the EB peptide extract showed a 32-fold higher antiviral effectiveness than the synthetic peptide against influenza A/H1N1 pdm. Extracts from untransformed and transformed microalgae and synthetic peptide did not show cytotoxic effect on MDCK cell monolayers.

In this work, we have examined the effect of different mutations in the 3'UTR of CPMV RNA-2 on expression levels using the reporter protein GFP encoded by the expression vector, pEAQexpress-HT-GFP. The results showed that the presence of a 3' UTR in the CPMV-HT system is important for achieving maximal expression levels. Removal of the entire 3' UTR reduced expression to approximately 30% of that obtained in its presence. It was found that the Y-shaped secondary structure formed by nucleotides 125-165 of the 3' UTR plays a key role in its function; mutations that disrupt this Y-shaped structure have an effect equivalent to the deletion of the entire 3' UTR. Our results suggest that the Y-shaped secondary structure acts by enhancing mRNA accumulation rather than by having a direct effect on RNA translation.

The MsrA2 peptide inhibited germination of S. musiva conidia at physiologically relevant low micromolar concentrations that were non-toxic to poplar protoplasts. The nucleotide sequence of MsrA2, optimized for expression in plants, was introduced into the commercial hybrid poplar Populus nigra L.*P. maximowiczii A.

Blood was shown to be more suitable for detection of Babesia cf. microti, whilst the spleen tissue was better for detection of H. canis than blood. Moreover, extremely low genetic variability of H. canis and its relatively low prevalence rate observed in this study may suggest that the parasite has only recently been introduced in the sampled area.

There is therefore a strong interest in developing bioenergy crops with reduced lignin content or altered lignin structures. Another desired trait for bioenergy crops is the ability to accumulate novel bioproducts, which would enhance the development of economically sustainable biorefineries. As previously demonstrated in the model plant Arabidopsis, expression of a 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase in plants offers the potential for decreasing lignin content and overproducing a value-added metabolic coproduct (i.e., protocatechuate) suitable for biological upgrading.RESULTS: The 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase QsuB from Corynebacterium glutamicum was expressed in the bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) using the stem-specific promoter of an O-methyltransferase gene (pShOMT) from sugarcane. The activity of pShOMT was validated in switchgrass after observation in-situ of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in stem nodes of plants carrying a pShOMT::GUS fusion construct. Under controlled growth conditions, engineered switchgrass lines containing a pShOMT::QsuB construct showed reductions of lignin content, improvements of biomass saccharification efficiency, and accumulated higher amount of protocatechuate compared to control plants. Attempts to generate transgenic switchgrass lines carrying the QsuB gene under the control of the constitutive promoter pZmUbi-1 were unsuccessful, suggesting possible toxicity issues associated with ectopic QsuB expression during the plant regeneration process.CONCLUSION: This study validates the transfer of the QsuB engineering approach from a model plant to switchgrass. We have demonstrated altered expression of two important traits: lignin content and accumulation of a co-product. We found that the choice of promoter to drive QsuB expression should be carefully considered when deploying this strategy to other bioenergy crops. Field-testing of engineered QsuB switchgrass are in progress to assess the performance of the introduced traits and agronomic performances of the transgenic plants.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,1471-2229,,MEDLINE:33478381,33478381,

Furthermore, exogenous auxin partly inhibited the tuber initiation, and exogenous cytokinin reduced the average tuber weight in most transformants at high sucrose content. The elevated auxin level in tubers of the transformants was accompanied with a decrease in content of cytokinin bases and their ribosides in tubers and most shoots. No concerted changes in contents of abscisic, jasmonic, salicylic acids and gibberellins in tubers were detected. The data on hormonal status indicated that the enhanced productivity of tms1 transformants was due to auxin and not mediated by other phytohormones. In addition, exogenous cytokinin was shown to upregulate the expression of genes encoding orthologs of auxin receptors. Overall, the results showed that tms1 expression and local increase in IAA level in transformants affect both the balance of endogenous cytokinins and the dynamics of tuberization in response to exogenous hormones (auxin, cytokinin), the latter reaction depending also on the carbohydrate supply. We introduce a basic model for the hormonal network controlling tuberization.",,,,,,,,,29,4,1,0,20,2,33,,,,1432-203X,,MEDLINE:27999977,27999977,

However, in vitro data is not available about its activity against commonly isolated bacteria in this country.METHODOLOGY: The analysis included clinical isolates, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs), representing 124 Escherichia coli, 75 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, identified using the MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for C/T was determined by the Etest (Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi, Italy). In addition, the disk diffusion (DD) test was used to determine the activity of C/T and of the antimicrobials routinely used to test for such pathogens.RESULTS: The C/T activity against the ESBL producers E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were similar (MIC90 value of 1 and 1.5 g/mL, respectively; susceptibility of 100% and 96%, respectively). However, the activity of C/T against the E. coli and K. pneumoniae MDR isolates was much lower (MIC90 value of 256 and 96 g/mL, respectively; susceptibility of 54% for each). The C/T MIC90 value for the non-MDR P. aeruginosa isolates was 3 g/mL and ≥ 256 g/mL for the MDR P. aeruginosa isolates (susceptibility of 96% vs 42% respectively). Overall, the C/T activities show comparable or higher susceptibility to the routinely used antimicrobials.CONCLUSION: The high in vitro activity of C/T points out its value as a possible alternative to the antimicrobials currently used for treatment of infections caused by such pathogens and would help in minimizing toxicity and bacterial resistance.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,,,,1972-2680,,MEDLINE:32683345,32683345,

Previous studies showed that the two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) play an important role in the intracellular survival of Brucella. To investigate if TCSs involve in the virulence and cytotoxicity of Brucella melitensis, we introduced a mutation into one of the TCSs in chromosome II in Br. melitensis 16M strain, and generated 16MDeltaTceSR, a mutant of Br. melitensis 16M strain. In vitro infection experiments using murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) showed that the survival of 16MDeltaTceSR mutant in macrophages decreased 0·91-log compared with that of wild type Br. melitensis 16M strain at 2 h postinfection, replication of 16MDeltaTceSR mutant in macrophages was 5·65-log, which was much lower than that wild type strain. Results of lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assays in macrophages demonstrated high dose infection with wide type strain produced high level cytotoxicity to macrophages, but 16MDeltaTceSR mutant had very low level cytotoxicity, indicating mutation of TCSs impaired the cytotoxicity of Br. melitensis to macrophages. Animal experiments showed that the spleen colonization of 16MDeltaTceSR was significantly reduced compared with its wild type strains. The lower levels of survival of 16MDeltaTceSR in various stress conditions suggested that the mutation of the TCSs of Br. melitensis was the causative factor of its reduced resistance to stress conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrated TCS TceSR involves in the intracellular survival, virulence and cytotoxicity of Br. melitensis during its infection. Significance and impact of the study: Two-component systems (TCSs) are predominant bacterial signal transduction mechanisms. The pathogenicity of Brucella is due to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment including low levels of acidic pH, high-salt and heat shock. TCSs are designed to sense diverse stimuli, transfer signals and enact an appropriate adaptive physiological response. Here, we show that Br. meilitensis TCS TceSR is not only involved in regulation of Br. meilitensis virulence and adaptation of environmental stresses, but also can regulate cytotoxicity in macrophages.",,,,,,,,,4,3,0,0,3,0,7,,,,1472-765X,,MEDLINE:25721466,25721466,

Because betalain possesses anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, it may be useful as a pharmaceutical agent and dietary supplement. Recent studies have identified the genes involved in the betalain biosynthesis of betanin. Amaranthin and celosianin II are abundant in the quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) hypocotyl, and amaranthin comprises glucuronic acid bound to betanin; therefore, this suggests the existence of a glucuronyltransferase involved in the synthesis of amaranthin in the quinoa hypocotyl. To identify the gene involved in amaranthin biosynthesis, we performed a BLAST analysis and phylogenetic tree analysis based on sequences homologous to flavonoid glycosyltransferase, followed by expression analysis on the quinoa hypocotyl to obtain three candidate proteins. Production of amaranthin in a transient Nicotiana benthamiana expression system was evaluated for these candidates and one was identified as having the ability to produce amaranthin. The gene encoding this protein was quinoa amaranthin synthetase 1 (CqAmaSy1).

Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a starchy root crop used for human consumption as a staple food and industrial applications. Starch is synthesized by various isoforms of several enzymes. However, the function of starch branching enzymes (SBEs) in starch biosynthesis and mechanisms of starch regulation in cassava have not been understood well. In this study, we aimed to suppress the expression of SBEs in cassava to generate starches with a range of distinct properties, in addition to verifying the functional characteristics of the SBEs. One SBE1, two SBE2, and one SBE3 genes were classified by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed tissue-specific expression of SBE genes in the tuberous roots and leaves of cassava. We introduced RNAi constructs containing fragments of SBE1, SBE2, or both genes into cassava by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and assessed enzymatic activity of SBE using tuberous roots and leaves from these transgenic plants. Simultaneous suppression of SBE1 and SBE2 rendered an extreme starch phenotype compared to suppression of SBE2 alone. Degree of polymerization of 6-13 chains in amylopectin was markedly reduced by suppression of both SBE1 and SBE2 in comparison to the SBE2 suppression; however, no change in chain-length profiles was observed in the SBE1 suppression alone. The role of SBE1 and SBE2 may have functional overlap in the storage tissue of cassava. Simultaneous suppression of SBE1 and SBE2 resulted in highly resistant starch with increased apparent amylose content compared to suppression of SBE2 alone.

The lettuce-derived IgA completely protected Vero cells from Stx1. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is thought to control mucosal infections and thus it may be applicable to oral passive immunotherapy. Edible plants are candidate hosts for producing oral formulations with SIgA against pathogenic agents. We previously established a recombinant IgA specific for the B subunit of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1B) consisting of the Fab fragment of Stx1B-specific monoclonal IgG and the Fc region of IgA (hyIgA). Here, we developed transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa) that produces hyIgA in a secretory form (S-hyIgA). An Arabidopsis-derived light-harvesting complex II (LHCB) promoter was used for the expression of all four transgenes (hyIgA heavy, light and j chains, and secretory component). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out to introduce genes into lettuce leaf discs by means of a single vector harboring all four transgenes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of the LHCB promoter, the expression of hyIgA transgenes was observed in leaf and stem tissues, which contain chloroplasts, at the mRNA and protein levels. The leaves produced hyIgA in a more than tenfold higher yield as compared with stems. The lettuce-derived S-hyIgA was found to bind to Stx1B in a dose-dependent manner by means of ELISA. A leaf extract of the transgenic lettuce completely neutralized the cytotoxicity of Stx1 against Vero cells, which are highly susceptible to Stx1. In conclusion, we established a transgenic lettuce producing a secretory form of hyIgA that can bind bacterial toxin. The results indicate that edible practical plants containing S-hyIgA will provide a possible means for immunotherapy for food poisoning.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:31222495,31222495,

The T-DNA region carries iaaM and iaaH genes for synthesis of the plant hormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). It has been demonstrated that the iaaM gene encodes a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide (IAM), and the iaaH gene encodes an amidase for subsequent conversion of IAM to IAA. In this article, we demonstrate that A. tumefaciens enhances the production of both IAA and phenylacetic acid (PAA), another auxin which does not show polar transport characteristics, in the formation of crown galls. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, we found that the endogenous levels of phenylacetamide (PAM) and PAA metabolites, as well as IAM and IAA metabolites, are remarkably increased in crown galls formed on the stem of tomato plants, implying that two distinct auxins are simultaneously synthesized via the IaaM-IaaH pathway. Moreover, we found that the induction of the iaaM gene dramatically elevated the levels of PAM, PAA and its metabolites, along with IAM, IAA and its metabolites, in Arabidopsis and barley.

HLB is associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas), a phloem-limited bacterium vectored by Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP). African Citrus Greening, associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter africanus' (CLaf) and its vector the African Citrus Triozid, Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera: Triozidae), are endemic to Africa, although not previously reported from Angola. African Greening is less severe than HLB, largely due to heat sensitivity of CLaf and its vector. Introduction of HLB into southern Africa would be devastating to citrus production in commercial and informal sectors. Concern was raised that CLas or ACP might hae inadvertently been introduced into Angola. In July 2019, a survey was conducted in two citrus nurseries in Luanda and Caxito and in different orchards on 7 farms surrounding Calulo and Quibala. Yellow sticky traps for insects were placed at the various localities and collected after c. 3 weeks. Breeding signs of T. erytreae (pit galls) were observed on citrus in some locations, but no insect vectors were detected on traps. Trees were inspected for signs and symptoms of citrus pests and diseases, particularly those that resemble HLB (foliar blotchy mottle, shoot chlorosis, vein yellowing and corking, lopsided fruit with aborted seeds and colour inversion) and its vectors (pit galls on leaves or waxy exudates). Leaves and shoots with suspect symptoms were sampled for laboratory analysis (43 samples). DNA was extracted from petiole and midrib tissue of leaves using a modified CTAB extraction protocol of Doyle and Doyle (1990). Real-time PCR was done using universal Liberibacter primers of Roberts et al. (2015), CLaf specific primers of Li et al. (2006) and CLas specific primers of Bao et al. (2019). All real-time PCR protocols indicated the presence of CLaf in 6 samples (Tab. S1). CLas or other citrus Liberibacter species were not detected. The presence of CLaf in sample 37 was confirmed by constructing a library (NEXTFLEX DNA Sequencing Kit, PerkinElmer) with extracted DNA and performing high-throughput sequencing on an Ion Torrent S5 platform (Central Analytical Facility, Stellenbosch University). To improve the quality of the reads, all 233,617,700 obtained reads were trimmed from the 3' end to a maximum length of 240 nt using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014). The high quality reads were mapped to the Citrus sinensis reference genome (NC_023046.1) using Bowtie 2.3.4 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) to subtract all the reads that had high identity to the host plant (number of mismatches allowed in the seed was set to 1). The 14,691,369 unmapped reads (6.2% of original data) were mapped to the CLaf reference genome NZ_CP004021.1 using CLC Genomics Workbench 10.1.1 (Qiagen) (Length fraction = 0.8; Similarity fraction = 0.9). A CLaf consensus genome was generated that spanned 99.7% of the reference genome and the 163001 mapped reads had a 22.9 mean read coverage. The consensus sequence was 99.7% identical to NZ_CP004021.1 and was submitted to Genbank as accession: CP054879. The positive CLaf detections were from trees with typical HLB or African Citrus Greening symptoms, viz. lopsided fruit with green stylar ends, aborted seed and stained columella at base of fruit button; yellow shoots with leaves showing symptoms of blotchy mottle and vein yellowing and corking (Fig. S1) in a commercial citrus farm outside Calulo and included 2 'Ponkan' mandarin (C. reticulata), 2 Valencia and 1 'Navelina' tree (C. sinensis), and a citrus nursery in Luanda (1 lime tree; C. aurantifolia) (Tab. S1). This first report of CLaf in Angola highlights the need to prevent spread by removing infected trees and managing the insect vector, as well as the need for further surveys to determine the occurrence of African Greening and its vectors in other provinces and to confirm the absence of exotic citrus pests and diseases.

In this study, industrial citric acid-producing strain A. niger YX-1217, capable of producing 180.0-200.0g/L, was modified to produce itaconic acid by metabolic engineering. A key gene cadA encoding aconitase was expressed in A. niger YX-1217 under the control of three different promoters. Analyses showed that the PglaA promoter resulted in higher levels of gene expression than the PpkiA and PgpdA promoters.

This study carried out functional characterization of HbICE1 (Inducer of CBF Expression 1) from H. brasiliensis. A nucleic protein with typical features of ICEs, HbICE1 was able to bind to MYC recognition sites and had strong transactivation activity. HbICE1 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues, with highest levels in the bark, and was up-regulated when subjected to various stresses including cold, dehydration, salinity and wounding. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis, 35S::HbICE1 plants showed enhanced cold resistance with increased proline content, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) metabolism and electrolyte leakage, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Expression of the cold responsive genes (COR15A, COR47, RD29A, and KIN1) was also significantly promoted in 35S::HbICE1 compared to wild-type plants under cold stress. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis showed that cold treatment changed genes expression profiles involved in many biological processes and phytohormones perception and transduction. Ethylene, JA, ABA, as well as ICE-CBF signaling pathways might work synergistically to cope with cold tolerance in rubber tree. Taken together, these findings suggest that HbICE1 is a member of the ICE gene family and a positive regulator of cold tolerance in H. brasiliensis.",,,,,,,,,15,6,0,0,10,0,21,,,1664-462X,,,MEDLINE:28878797,28878797,

PTGS mechanisms rely on sequence identity between the transgene and native genes; therefore, designing genes with mutations that do not cause amino acid changes, known as synonymous mutations, may avoid PTGS. For proof of concept, the sequence of acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCase) from creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) was altered with synonymous mutations. A native bentgrass ACCase was cloned and used as a template for the modified gene. Wild-type(WT) and modified genes were further modified with a non-synonymous mutation, coding for an isoleucine to leucine substitution at position 1781, known to confer resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. Five-hundred calli of creeping bentgrass 'Penn A-4' were inoculated with Agrobacterium containing either the WT or modified genes, with or without the herbicide-resistance mutation. Six herbicide-resistant-transgenic events containing the modified gene with the 1781 mutation were obtained. Transcription of the modified ACCase was confirmed in transgenic plants, showing that gene-silencing mechanisms were avoided. Transgenic plants were confirmed to be resistant to the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide, sethoxydim, providing evidence that the modified gene was functional.

The genome of L. starkeyi has been published, which opens the door to production strain improvements through the development and use of the tools of synthetic biology for this oleaginous species.

As we reach the limits of expanding arable land, the responsibility of meeting this production goal will rely on increasing yields. Traditional plant breeding practices will not be able to realistically meet these expectations, thrusting plant biotechnology into the limelight to fulfill these needs. Better varieties will need to be developed faster and with the least amount of regulatory hurdles. With the need to add, delete, and substitute genes into existing genomes, the field of genome editing and gene targeting is now rapidly developing with numerous new technologies coming to the forefront. Agrobacterium-mediated crop transformation has been the most utilized method to generate transgenic varieties that are better yielding, have new traits, and are disease and pathogen resistant. Genome-editing technologies rely on the creation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genomic DNA of target species to facilitate gene disruption, addition, or replacement through either non-homologous end joining or homology-dependent repair mechanisms. DSBs can be introduced through the use of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), or clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas nucleases, among others. Agrobacterium strains have been employed to deliver the reagents for genome editing to the specific target cells. Understanding the biology of transformation from the perspective not only of Agrobacterium, but also of the host, from processing of T-DNA to its integration in the host genome, has resulted in a wealth of information that has been used to engineer Agrobacterium strains having increased virulence.

The results indicated that most of the Las-infected samples collected from Thailand contained at least one prophage sequence with 48.29% containing prophage 1 (FP1), 63.26% containing prophage 2 (FP2), and 19.38% containing both prophages. Interestingly, FP2 was found to be the predominant population in Las-infected citrus samples while Las-infected psyllids contained primarily FP1. The multiple banding patterns that resulted from amplification of lasAI imply extensive variation exists within the full and partial repeat sequence while the single band from lasAII indicates a low amount of variation within the repeat sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of Las-infected samples from 22 provinces in Thailand suggested that the bacterial pathogen may have been introduced to Thailand from China and the Philippines. This is the first report evaluating the genetic variation of a large population of Ca. L. asiaticus infected samples in Thailand using the two effector genes from Las prophage regions.",,,,,,,,,14,2,0,0,14,0,16,,,,1932-6203,,MEDLINE:25437428,25437428,

The current study report GS3.1, a QTL that regulates rice grain size via metabolic flux allocation between two branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism. GS3.1 encodes a MATE (multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion) transporter that regulates grain size by directing the transport of p-coumaric acid from the p-coumaric acid biosynthetic metabolon to the flavonoid biosynthetic metabolon. A natural allele of GS3.1 was identified from an African rice with enlarged grains, reduced flavonoid content and increased lignin content in the panicles. Notably, the natural allele of GS3.1 caused no alterations in other tissues and did not affect stress tolerance, revealing an ideal candidate for breeding efforts.

Dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs) are important plant transcription factors that regulate the expression of many stress-inducible genes and play a critical role in improving the abiotic stress tolerance. Transgenic chickpea lines harbouring transcription factor, Dehydration Responsive Element-Binding protein 1A from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtDREB1a gene) driven by stress inducible promoter rd29a were developed, with the intent of enhancing drought tolerance in chickpea. Performance of the progenies of one transgenic event and control were assessed based on key physiological traits imparting drought tolerance such as plant water relation characteristics, chlorophyll retention, photosynthesis, membrane stability and water use efficiency under water stressed conditions.RESULTS: Four transgenic chickpea lines harbouring stress inducible AtDREB1a were generated with transformation efficiency of 0.1%. The integration, transmission and regulated expression were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Southern Blot hybridization and Reverse Transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Transgenic chickpea lines exhibited higher relative water content, longer chlorophyll retention capacity and higher osmotic adjustment under severe drought stress (stress level 4), as compared to control. The enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic chickpea lines were also manifested by undeterred photosynthesis involving enhanced quantum yield of PSII, electron transport rate at saturated irradiance levels and maintaining higher relative water content in leaves under relatively severe soil water deficit. Further, lower values of carbon isotope discrimination in some transgenic chickpea lines indicated higher water use efficiency. Transgenic chickpea lines exhibiting better OA resulted in higher seed yield, with progressive increase in water stress, as compared to control.CONCLUSIONS: Based on precise phenotyping, involving non-invasive chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, carbon isotope discrimination, osmotic adjustment, higher chlorophyll retention and membrane stability index, it can be concluded that AtDREB1a transgenic chickpea lines were better adapted to water deficit by modifying important physiological traits.

Identifying and targeting factors essential for virulence or development unique to fungal pathogens is one approach to develop novel treatments for fungal infections. In this study, we present the identification and functional characterization of a novel developmental regulator in Aspergillus fumigatus, AfMed15, which contained a conserved Med15_fungal domain, as determined by screening of a mutant library that contained more than 2,000 hygromycin-resistant A. fumigatus transformants. Downregulating the expression of Afmed15 abolished the conidiation and decreased the fungal virulence in an insect model. Strikingly, the overexpression of Afmed15 caused fungal death accompanied by intensive autophagy. RNA sequencing of an Afmed15 overexpression strain revealed that altered gene expression patterns were associated with carbon metabolism, energy metabolism, and translation. Interestingly, the addition of metal ions could partially rescue fungal death caused by the overexpression of Afmed15, indicating that disordered ion homeostasis is a potential reason for the fungal death caused by the overexpression of Afmed15 Considering that the precise expression of Afmed15 is crucial for fungal development, virulence, and survival and that no ortholog was found in humans, Afmed15 is an ideal target for antifungal-drug development.IMPORTANCE The identification and characterization of regulators essential for virulence or development constitute one approach for antifungal drug development.

Few attempts have been made to analyze the ecological aspects that influence pathogen infection in small mammals in livestock production systems. We describe the infection of small mammals with Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., Trichinella spp. and Cysticercus fasciolaris and assess the related intrinsic and extrinsic factors in livestock production systems in central Argentina at the small mammal community, population and individual levels.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten pig farms and eight dairy farms were studied by removal trapping of small mammals from 2008 to 2011. Each farm was sampled seasonally over the course of one year with cage and Sherman live traps. The 505 small mammals captured (14,359 trap-nights) included three introduced murine rodents, four native rodents and two opossums. Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp. antibodies and Trichinella spp. were found in the three murine rodents and both opossums. Rattus norvegicus was also infected with C. fasciolaris; Akodon azarae and Oligoryzomys flavescens with Leptospira spp.; anti-Brucella spp. antibodies were found in A. azarae. Two or more pathogens occurred simultaneously on 89% of the farms, and each pathogen was found on at least 50% of the farms. Pathogen infections increased with host abundance. Infection by Leptospira spp. also increased with precipitation and during warm seasons. The occurrence of anti-Brucella spp. antibodies was higher on dairy farms and during the winter and summer. The host abundances limit values, from which farms are expected to be free of the studied pathogens, are reported.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Murine rodents maintain pathogens within farms, whereas other native species are likely dispersing pathogens among farms.

Infection is a common complication for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern. It is therefore crucial to monitor AMR patterns in order to support clinical decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship strategies. Clinical microbiologists should provide annual cumulative antibiogram reports, which can be used to guide initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for the management of infections.OBJECTIVES. To analyse the cumulative antibiograms for the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) combined adult multidisciplinary ICU and high-care unit (HCU) for 2013 and 2017, compare the antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) patterns between the 2 years, and analyse the subset of blood culture isolates.METHODS. A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed of routine bacterial and fungal culture and AST data extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service laboratory information system for the ICU/HCU. Only the first diagnostic isolate of a given species per patient per year was included in the analysis. All analysis and reporting were done in accordance with the applicable Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.RESULTS. Enterobacteriaceae predominated in first-isolate cultures in 2013 (60%) and 2017 (56%). There was an overall decrease in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from 2013 (42%) to 2017 (30%) (p=0.013), accompanied by an increase in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from 2013 (4%) to 2017 (11%) (p=0.24). Although the total percentage of Acinetobacter spp. decreased in 2017 (p=0.021), the proportion of extensively drug-resistant isolates doubled to 68% in 2017 (p<0.001). The percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decreased significantly from 49% to 14% (p<0.001), along with a significant decrease in vancomycin-resistant enterococci from 17% to 0% (p=0.001). Candida auris increased from 0% in 2013 to 11% in 2017 (p=0.002), and non-albicans Candida spp. predominated (80%) in blood cultures in 2017 (p=0.023).CONCLUSIONS. Appropriate selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be guided by the ICU-specific antibiogram. The recommended empirical antimicrobial therapy at the CMJAH ICU/HCU based on the antibiogram analysis would include ertapenem to cover the Enterobacteriaceae. Amikacin is recommended for empirical treatment of suspected pseudomonal infections. Additional empirical antimicrobial therapy for Gram-positive organisms is not routinely advocated, and empirical antifungal therapy with amphotericin Β or micafungin is only appropriate in patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,,,2078-5135,,,SCIELO:S0256-95742020000100013,,

Introducing desirable traits into this valuable plant by the conventional breeding has so far been faced with some restrictions due to the limited gene pool and cross-incompatibility. Therefore, breeders have decided to exploit Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods in order to satisfy the growing market demands. However, more efficient in vitro regeneration protocols are required for this approach.OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to develop an efficient protocol for an in vitro plant regeneration by the examining the effects of various combinations and concentrations of the plant growth regulators (PGRs) and different explants types.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaf and petiole explants of the Chrysanthemum morifolium cv. 'Resomee Splendid' were collected from the in vitro grown plantlets. Murashige and Skooge (MS) medium was supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of benzylaminopurine (BAP), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and thidiazuron (TDZ). Thereafter, the effects of these hormonal treatments were investigated on shoot initiation percentage, the average number of shoots per explants, callogenesis, and the type of organogenesis in regard to both types of the explants.RESULTS: Shoots were directly formed from leaf explants on the media that only contained BAP without callus formation. Amongst the other hormonal treatments, a combination of 4.5 mg.L-1 BAP plus 1 mg.L-1 NAA resulted in the direct organogenesis from the leaf explants, which was superior to the other combinations and concentrations. In regard to the petiole explants, direct shoot formation occurred in all the media except for the ones which were fortified with TDZ. In this case, considering the shoot initiation percentage and the mean shoot number per explants, the best results were achieved in the medium supplemented with 1.5 mg.L-1 BAP and 1 mg.L-1 NAA. Results showed that interaction of either BAP or TDZ with NAA was necessary for the callus induction.CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in shoot initiation percentage and the average number of shoots per explants were observed both in leaves and petioles grown on different media. Moreover, the callogenesis rates, as well as organogenesis types, showed some differences among the studied explants when compared on the same media.",,,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,1728-3043,,,MEDLINE:30805383,30805383,

Its overexpression in Camelina sativa effectively alters plant development and terpenoid metabolism. Geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) converts one isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate to GPP. Here, we report a synthetic insect-plant GPPS gene and effects of its overexpression on plant growth and terpenoid metabolism of Camelina sativa. We synthesized a 1353-bp cDNA, namely PTP-MpGPPS. This synthetic cDNA was composed of a 1086-bp cDNA fragment encoding a small GPPS isomer of the aphid Myzus persicae (Mp), 240-bp Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA fragment encoding a plastidial transit peptide (PTP), and a 27-bp short cDNA fragment encoding a human influenza hemagglutinin tag peptide. Structural modeling showed that the deduced protein was a homodimeric prenyltransferase. Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that the PTP-MpGPPS fused with green florescent protein was localized in the plastids. The synthetic PTP-MpGPPS cDNA driven by 2*35S promoters was introduced into Camelina (Camelina sativa) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and its overexpression in transgenic plants were demonstrated by western blot. T2 and T3 progeny of transgenic plants developed larger leaves, grew more and longer internodes, and flowered earlier than wild-type plants. Metabolic analysis showed that the levels of beta-amyrin and campesterol were higher in tissues of transgenic plants than in those of wild-type plants. Fast isoprene sensor analysis demonstrated that transgenic Camelina plants emitted significantly less isoprene than wild-type plants. In addition, transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression levels of gibberellic acid and brassinosteroids-responsive genes were higher in transgenic plants than in wild-type plants.

Gene conversion in the nitrogenase (nifH) multigene family of Rhizobium etli was analyzed by using a two-plasmid system, where each plasmid carried a copy of nifH. One of the nifH copies was modified, creating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) spaced along the gene. Once the modified plasmid was introduced into R. etli, selection was done for cointegration with a resident plasmid lacking the RFLPs. Most of the cointegrate molecules harbor gene conversion events, biased toward a gain of RFLPs. This bias may be explained under the double-strand break repair model by proposing that the nifH gene lacking the RFLPs suffers a DNA double-strand break, so the incoming plasmid functions as a template for repairing the homolog on the resident plasmid. To support this proposal, we cloned an SceI site into the nifH homolog that had the RFLPs used for scoring gene conversion. In vivo expression of the meganuclease I-SceI allowed the generation of a double-strand break on this homolog. Upon introduction of this modified plasmid into an R. etli strain lacking I-SceI, biased gene conversion still favored the retention of markers on the incoming plasmid. In contrast, when the recipient strain ectopically expressed I-SceI, a dramatic reversal in gene conversion bias was seen, favoring the preservation of resident sequences. These results show that biased gene conversion is caused by preferential double-strand breaks on one of the recombining homologs.IMPORTANCE: In this work, we analyzed gene conversion by using a system that entails horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination in the recipient cell. Most gene conversion events are biased toward the acquisition of the incoming sequences, ranging in size from 120 bp to 800 bp. This bias is due to preferential cutting of resident DNA and can be reversed upon introduction of a double-strand break on the incoming sequence. Since conditions used in this work are similar to those in horizontal gene transfer, it provides evidence that, upon transfer, the resident DNA preferentially acquires gene variants.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,,1098-5530,,MEDLINE:26598365,26598365,

Abiotic stresses, such as soil salinity and drought, negatively affect growth, development, and yield in cotton. Gene ABP9, which encodes a bZIP transcription factor, binds to the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive-element (ABRE2) motif of the maize catalase1 gene. Its expression significantly improves tolerance in Arabidopsis to multiple abiotic stresses, but little is known about its role in cotton. In the present study, the ABP9 gene was introduced into upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivar R15 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, and 12 independent transgenic cotton lines were obtained. Cotton plants over-expressing ABP9 have enhanced tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. Under stress, they developed better root systems in a greenhouse and higher germination, reduced stomatal aperture, and stomatal density in a growth chamber. Under drought conditions, survival rate and relative water content (RWC) of transgenic cotton were higher than those of R15 plants. Under salt and osmotic stresses, chlorophyll, proline, and soluble sugar contents significantly increased in transgenic cotton leaves and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was lower than in R15. Overexpression of ABP9 also enhanced oxidative stress tolerance, reduced cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through increased activities of antioxidative enzymes, and alleviated oxidative damage to cell. Interestingly, ABP9 over-expressing cotton was more sensitive to exogenous ABA than R15 at seed germination, root growth, stomatal aperture, and stomatal density. Moreover, ABP9 overexpression upregulated significantly the transcription levels of stress-related genes such as GhDBP2, GhNCED2, GhZFP1, GhERF1, GhHB1, and GhSAP1 under salt treatment. Conjointly, these results showed that overexpression of ABP9 conferred enhanced tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in cotton. The stress-tolerant transgenic lines provide valuable resources for cotton breeding.",,,,,,,,,69,10,0,0,59,1,79,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:28474114,28474114,

Yield loss due to fungal disease of stem rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a serious problem in canola cultivation. Thaumatin-like proteins are large groups of the pathogenesis-related proteins which provide resistance to the fungal infection in response to invading pathogens and play a key role in plant defense system. Objectives: Transformation of the rice tlp into canola via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of the expressed TLP in the transgenic events on the S. sclerotiorum growth was subject to investigation. Materials and methods: The canola (R line Hyola308) was used for transformation experiment. The vector, pBITLPRA1, was used for the stable transformation. The PCR and southern blotting techniques were used to confirm transgene's presence in the transgenic canola events. Antifungal activity of transgenic plants was evaluated by the radial diffusion and spore germination assays. T2 transgenic plants were evaluated by the intact leaf inoculation method in greenhouse assay. Results: In this study, pBITLPRA1 construct containing tlp gene was introduced into canola and the transformed plants were verified by PCR. The glucanase activity of tlp gene in T0 generation was measured and transgenic plants with high activity were assessed by Southern blot analysis to confirm the copy number of the gene. Also, antifungal activity of the single copy T0 transgenic plants against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was evaluated by radial diffusion and spore germination assays. In greenhouse assay, evaluation of T2 transgenic plants by the intact leaf inoculation method demonstrated that following the infection with S. sclerotiorum, there was a significant reduction in the lesion's diameter in transgenic lines compared to the non-transgenic ones. Conclusions: These results revealed that expression of TLP has an inhibitory effect against fungus compared to non-transgenic plants both in vitro and in vivo (i.e., greenhouse condition).

The T4SSs are divided into two phylogenetic subfamilies, namely, IVA and IVB, or on the basis of the phylogeny of the VirB4 ATPase, into eight groups. The conjugation system of the IncM group plasmid pCTX-M3, from Citrobacter freundii, is classified in the IVB subfamily and in the MPFI group, as are the conjugation systems of IncI1 group plasmids. Although the majority of the conjugative genes of the IncM and IncI1 plasmids display conserved synteny, there are several differences. Here, we present a deletion analysis of 27 genes in the conjugative transfer regions of pCTX-M3. Notably, the deletion of either of two genes dispensable for conjugative transfer, namely, orf35 and orf36, resulted in an increased plasmid mobilization efficiency. Transcriptional analysis of the orf35 and orf36 deletion mutants suggested an involvement of these genes in regulating the expression of conjugative transfer genes. We also revised the host range of the pCTX-M3 replicon by finding that this replicon is unable to support replication in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ralstonia eutropha, and Pseudomonas putida, though its conjugation system is capable of introducing plasmids bearing oriTpCTX-M3 into these bacteria, which are representatives of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, respectively. Thus, the conjugative transfer system of pCTX-M3 has a much broader host range than its replicon.IMPORTANCE Horizontal gene transfer is responsible for rapid changes in bacterial genomes, and the conjugative transfer of plasmids has a great impact on the plasticity of bacteria.

After the identification of a conserved AGO1-binding GW/WG motif in potyviral HCPros, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a tryptophan-to-alanine change into the HCPro (HCProAG) of PVA (PVAAG) and turnip mosaic virus (TuMVAG).

Although the mutation did not interfere with HCPro's complementation or silencing suppression capacity, it nevertheless impaired virus particle accumulation and the systemic spread of both PVA and TuMV. Furthermore, we found that the HCPro-AGO1 interaction was important for AGO1's association with the PVA coat protein.

However, terrestrial plants often suffer from iron deficiency in alkaline soil due to its extremely low solubility. Alkaline soil accounts for about 30% of all cultivated ground in the world. Plants have evolved two distinct strategies, I and II, for iron uptake from the soil. Dicots and non-graminaceous monocots use Strategy I, which is primarily based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) and the uptake of iron(II) by the iron-regulated transporter, IRT1. In contrast, graminaceous plants use Strategy II to efficiently acquire insoluble iron(III). Strategy II comprises the synthesis and secretion of iron-chelating phytosiderophores, such as mugineic acids and the Yellow Stripe 1 transporter proteins of the iron(III)-phytosiderophore complex. Barley, which exhibits the highest tolerance to iron deficiency in alkaline soil among graminaceous plants, utilizes mugineic acids and the specific iron(III)-mugineic acids transporter, HvYS1.

Thymol is the most important substance in the essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi.

Analysis of the full-length sequences determined showed the virus to be a variant of Chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) and the betasatellite to be a variant of Tomato leaf curl betasatellite (ToLCB). Both the virus and the betasatellite isolated from tobacco show the greatest levels of sequence identity to isolates of ChiLCV and ToLCB identified in other hosts in Oman. Additionally clones of ChiLCV and ToLCB were shown, by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation, to be infectious to 3 Nicotiana species, including N. tabacum. In N. benthamiana the betasatellite was shown to change the upward leaf rolling symptoms to a severe downward leaf curl, as is typical for many monopartite begomoviruses with betasatellites.CONCLUSIONS: The leaf curl disease of tobacco in Oman was shown to be caused by ChiLCV and ToLCB. This is the first identification of ChiLCV with ToLCB infecting tobacco. The study shows that, despite the low diversity of begomoviruses and betasatellites in Oman, the extant viruses/betasatellites are able to fill the niches that present themselves.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,5,0,5,,,,1743-422X,,MEDLINE:31706358,31706358,

Here, we describe an efficient gene editing strategy for hybrid poplar, (Populus tremula * alba INRA clone 717-1B4) based on the Golden Gate MoClo cloning. To test the system efficiency for generating single gene mutants, two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and incorporated into the MoClo Tool Kit level 2 binary vector with the Cas9 expression cassette to mutate the SHORT ROOT (SHR) gene. Moreover, we also tested its efficiency for introducing mutations in two genes simultaneously by expressing one sgRNA targeting a single site of the YUC4 gene and the other sgRNA targeting the PLT1 gene. For a robust evaluation of the approach, we repeated the strategy to target the LBD12 and LBD4 genes simultaneously, using an independent construct. We generated hairy roots by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated leaf transformation. Sequencing results confirmed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation in the targeted sites of PtaSHR. Biallelic and homozygous knockout mutations were detected. A deletion spanning both target sites and small insertions/deletions were the most common mutations. Out of the 22 SHR alleles sequenced, 21 were mutated. The phenotype's characterization showed that transgenic roots with biallelic mutations for the SHR gene lacked a defined endodermal single cell layer, suggesting a conserved gene function similar to its homolog in Arabidopsis Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Sequencing results also revealed the high efficiency of the system for generating double mutants. Biallelic mutations for both genes in the yuc4/plt1 and lbd12/lbd4 roots were detected in three (yuc4/plt1) and two (lbd12/lbd4) out of four transgenic roots evaluated.

Besides T-DNA integrated by natural transformation of plant vegetative tissues by pathogenic Agrobacterium spp., previous reports have indicated that T-DNA sequences originating from an ancestral Agrobacterium sp. are present in the genomes of all cultivated sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) varieties analyzed. Expression of an Agrobacterium-derived agrocinopine synthase (ACS) gene was detected in leaf and root tissues of sweet potato, suggesting that the plant can produce agrocinopine, a sugar-phosphodiester opine considered to be utilized by some strains of Agrobacterium spp. in crown gall. To validate the product synthesized by Ipomoea batatas ACS (IbACS), we introduced IbACS into tobacco under a constitutive promoter. High-voltage paper electrophoresis followed by alkaline silver nitrate staining detected the production of an agrocinopine-like substance in IbACS1-expressing tobacco, and further mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the product confirmed that IbACS can produce agrocinopine A from natural plant substrates. The partially purified compound was biologically active in an agrocinopine A bioassay. A 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing and meta-transcriptome analysis revealed that the rhizosphere microbial community of tobacco was affected by the expression of IbACS. A new species of Leifsonia (actinobacteria) was isolated as an enriched bacterium in the rhizosphere of IbACS1-expressing tobacco. This Leifsonia sp. can catabolize agrocinopine A produced in tobacco, indicating that the production of agrocinopine A attracts rhizosphere bacteria that can utilize this sugar-phosphodiester. These results suggest a potential role of IbACS conserved among sweet potato cultivars in manipulating their microbial community.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Nicotiana tabacum has emerged as a suitable host for metabolic engineering of terpenoids and derivatives in tall glandular trichomes, which actively synthesize and secrete specialized metabolites. However, implementation of an entire biosynthetic pathway in glandular trichomes requires the identification of trichome-specific promoters to appropriately drive the expression of the transgenes needed to set up the desired pathway. In this context, RT-qPCR analysis was carried out on wild-type N. tabacum plants to compare the expression pattern and gene expression level of NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1, two newly identified genes expressed in glandular trichomes, with those of NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2alpha, NtCPS2, and NtLTP1, which were reported in the literature to be specifically expressed in glandular trichomes. We show that NtRbcS-T1 and NtMALD1 are specifically expressed in glandular trichomes like NtCYP71D16, NtCBTS2alpha, and NtCPS2, while NtLTP1 is also expressed in other leaf tissues as well as in the stem. Transcriptional fusions of each of the six promoters to the GUS-VENUS reporter gene were introduced in N. tabacum by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Almost all transgenic lines displayed GUS activity in tall glandular trichomes, indicating that the appropriate cis regulatory elements were included in the selected promoter regions. However, unlike for the other promoters, no trichome-specific line was obtained for pNtLTP1:GUS-VENUS, in agreement with the RT-qPCR data. These data thus provide two new transcription promoters that could be used in metabolic engineering of glandular trichomes.",,,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,4,0,6,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:32020353,32020353,

Improving maize yield is important to achieve food security and agricultural sustainability in the 21st century.

Here, ictB from Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 was inserted into maize using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In three controlled-environment experiments, ictB insertion increased leaf starch and sucrose content by up to 25% relative to controls. Experimental field trials in four growing seasons, spanning the Midwestern United States (Summers 2018 & 2019) and Argentina (Winter 2018 & 2019), showed an average of 3.49% grain yield improvement, by as much as 5.4% in a given season and up to 9.4% at certain trial locations. A subset of field trial locations was used to test for modification of ear traits and ФPSII, a proxy for photosynthesis. Results suggested that yield gain in transgenics could be associated with increased ФPSII, and the production of longer, thinner ears with more kernels. ictB localized primarily to the microsome fraction of leaf bundle-sheath cells, but not to chloroplasts. Extramembrane domains of ictB interacted in vitro with proteins involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence of ictB insertion into a species using C4 photosynthesis and the largest-scale demonstration of grain yield enhancement from ictB insertion in planta.

Increased grain yields due to the soil fertility treatments was evident for 99% target farmers. On average, I and P increased grain yield by 21% and 25% respectively, while the combined application of I and P resulted in a 38% increase.

The pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is a prominent invasive plant-parasitic nematode and has become a serious worldwide threat to forest ecosystems. Presently, the complete genome sequence of B. xylophilus has been published, and research involving genome-wide functional analyses is likely to increase. In this study, we describe the construction of an effective silencing vector, pDH-RH, which contains a transcriptional unit for a hairpin loop structure. Utilising this vector, double-stranded (ds)RNAs with sequences homologous to the target genes can be expressed in a transformed filamentous fungus via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation technology, and can subsequently induce the knockdown of target gene mRNA expression in B. xylophilus by allowing the nematode to feed on the fungal transformants. Four dumpy genes (Bx-dpy-2, 4, 10 and 11) were used as targets to detect RNAi efficiency. By allowing the nematode to feed on target gene-transformed Fusarium oxysporum strains, target transcripts were knocked down 34-87% compared with those feeding on the wild-type strain as determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Morphological RNAi phenotypes were observed, displaying obviously reduced body length; weak dumpy or small (short and thin) body size; or general abnormalities. Moreover, compensatory regulation and non-specific silencing of dpy genes were found in B. xylophilus. Our results indicate that RNAi delivery by feeding in B. xylophilus is a successful technique. This platform may provide a new opportunity for undertaking RNAi-based, genome-wide gene functional studies in vitro in B. xylophilus. Moreover, as B. xylophilus feeds on endophytic fungi when a host has died, RNAi feeding technology will offer the prospect for developing a novel control strategy for the nematode. Furthermore, this platform may also be applicable to other parasitic nematodes that have a facultative, fungivorous habit.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,6,0,9,,,,1879-0135,,MEDLINE:26953254,26953254,

D. citri possesses a vertically transmitted intracellular symbiont, Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), which produces diaphorin; a polyketide that is toxic to various eukaryotic organisms. Our previous study demonstrated that the total amount and average concentration of diaphorin in adult D. citri, when homogeneous distribution is assumed within the insect, are sufficient to exert inhibitory effects on fungi and insects, including the Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae); one of the major predators of D. citri. However, diaphorin may be localized to a limited body area within D. citri, and its concentration may change during development. In the present study, to better understand the physiological and ecological function of diaphorin, we assessed the distribution of diaphorin within the D. citri body and analyzed concentrations of diaphorin in various developmental stages. Expression of genes involved in diaphorin synthesis was also analyzed. The results demonstrated that diaphorin is distributed widely in the D. citri body, which appears to be a prerequisite for effective deterrence of natural enemies. The concentration of diaphorin was shown to change significantly during the development of D. citri. It was highest in mature adults, followed by embryos and teneral adults, and lowest in nymphs. The lowest concentrations of diaphorin observed in nymphs are still presumed to be effective in deterring invasive natural enemies, including parasites, parasitoids, and entomopathogenic fungi. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that amounts of transcripts for diaphorin synthesis genes dipP and dipT were at a minimum in embryos, increased during the nymphal period, and reached a maximum level just after adult eclosion. The alteration pattern of the amounts of transcripts for diaphorin synthesis genes appeared to partially disagree with that of the concentration of diaphorin.

Several genes dealing with early signal transduction have been cloned, and one of them encodes the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase (SymRK; also termed NORK). The Symbiosis Receptor Kinase gene is required by legumes to establish a root endosymbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria as well as mycorrhizal fungi. Using degenerate primer and BAC sequencing, we cloned duplicated SymRK homeologues in soybean called GmSymRKalpha and GmSymRKbeta. These duplicated genes have high similarity of nucleotide (96%) and amino acid sequence (95%). Sequence analysis predicted a malectin-like domain within the extracellular domain of both genes.

Uncovering the mechanism of how host factors are involved in virus infection could pave the way to defeat viral disease. In this study, we characterized a lipid transfer protein, designated NbLTP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana, which was downregulated after Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) inoculation. BaMV accumulation significantly decreased in NbLTP1-knockdown leaves and protoplasts compared with the controls. The subcellular localization of the NbLTP1-orange fluorescent protein (OFP) was mainly the extracellular matrix. However, when we removed the signal peptide (NbLTP1/DeltaSP-OFP), most of the expressed protein targeted chloroplasts. Both NbLTP1-OFP and NbLTP1/DeltaSP-OFP were localized in chloroplasts when we removed the cell wall. These results suggest that NbLTP1 may have a secondary targeting signal. Transient overexpression of NbLTP1 had no effect on BaMV accumulation, but that of NbLTP1/DeltaSP significantly increased BaMV expression. NbLTP1 may be a positive regulator of BaMV accumulation especially when its expression is associated with chloroplasts, where BaMV replicates. The mutation was introduced to the predicted phosphorylation site to simulate the phosphorylated status, NbLTP/DeltaSP/P(+), which could still assist BaMV accumulation. By contrast, a mutant lacking calmodulin-binding or simulates the phosphorylation-negative status could not support BaMV accumulation. The lipid-binding activity of LTP1 was reported to be associated with calmodulin-binding and phosphorylation, by which the C-terminus functional domain of NbLTP1 may play a critical role in BaMV accumulation.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,0,5,,,,1999-4915,,MEDLINE:33261222,33261222,

First, the competitiveness of native-naturalized rhizobia strains selected for their efficiency to fix N2 in clover and tagged with gusA was evaluated in controlled conditions with different soils. Second, three of these experimental strains with superior nodule occupancy plus the currently recommended commercial inoculant, an introduced strain, were tested in the field in 2 years and at two sites. Plant establishment, herbage productivity, fixation of atmospheric N2 (15N natural abundance), and nodule occupancy (ERIC-PCR genomic fingerprinting) were measured. In both years and sites, nodule occupancy of the native-naturalized experimental strains was either higher or similar to that of the commercial inoculant in both primary and secondary roots. The difference was even greater in stolon roots nodules, where nodule occupancy of the native-naturalized experimental strains was at least five times greater. The amount of N fixed per unit plant mass was consistently higher with native-naturalized experimental strains, although the proportion of N derived from atmospheric fixation was similar for all strains.

Particularly during the warmer seasons, variations in habitat temperature may introduce episodes of stressful temperatures which the organisms must adapt to and compensate for to maintain physiological homeostasis. The marine environment is changing and predicted raises in water temperatures will affect numerous marine species. Translocation of pathogens follow migration of species and alternations in physical environmental parameters may have influence upon the virulence of pathogens, as well as the hosts immune responses. While pathogenicity of many true pathogens is expected to increase following climate induced temperature stress, the impact from environmental stressors on the occurrence and severity of opportunistic infections is unknown. Here we describe how thermal stress in the cold-water species Atlantic cod influenced the fish immune responses against an opportunistic intracellular bacterium. Following experimental infection with Brucella pinnipedialis at normal water temperature (6°C) and sub-optimal temperature (15°C), cod cleared the intracellular bacteria more rapidly at the highest temperature. The overall immune response was faster and of higher amplitude at 15°C, however, a significant number of cod died at this temperature despite efficient clearance of infection. An increased growth rate not affected by infection was observed at 15°C, confirming multiple energy demanding processes taking place. Serum chemistry suggested that general homeostasis was influenced by both infection and increased water temperature, highlighting the cumulative stress responses (allostatic load) generated by simultaneous stressors. Our results suggest a trade-off between resistance and tolerance to survive infection at sub-optimal temperatures and raise questions concerning the impact of increased water temperatures on the energetic costs of immune system activation in aquatic ectotherms.",,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,12,0,13,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:30564213,30564213,

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce knockout mutations in the tef orthologue of the rice SEMIDWARF-1 (SD-1) gene to confer semidwarfism and ultimately lodging resistance. High frequency recovery of transgenic and SD-1 edited tef lines was achieved in two tef cultivars by Agrobacterium-mediated delivery into young leaf explants of gene editing reagents along with transformation and regeneration enhancing morphogenic genes, BABY BOOM (BBM) and WUSCHEL2 (WUS2). All of the 23 lines analyzed by next-generation sequencing had at least two or more alleles of SD-1 mutated. Of these, 83% had tetra-allelic frameshift mutations in the SD-1 gene in primary tef regenerants, which were inherited in subsequent generations. Phenotypic data generated on T1 and T2 generations revealed that the sd-1 lines have reduced culm and internode lengths with no reduction in either panicle or peduncle lengths. These characteristics are comparable with rice sd-1 plants. Measurements of lodging, in greenhouse-grown plants, showed that sd-1 lines have significantly higher resistance to lodging at the heading stage compared with the controls.

Viruses can act as extracellular reservoirs of bacterial genes, can mediate microbiome dynamics, and can influence the virulence of clinical pathogens. Various targeted metagenomic analysis techniques detect viral sequences, but these methods often exclude large and genome integrated viruses. In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of nine state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools, including Vibrant, VirSorter, VirSorter2, VirFinder, DeepVirFinder, MetaPhinder, Kraken 2, Phybrid, and a BLAST search using identified proteins from the Earth Virome Pipeline to identify viral contiguous sequences (contigs) across simulated metagenomes with different read distributions, taxonomic compositions, and complexities.RESULTS: Of the tools tested in this study, VirSorter achieved the best F1 score while Vibrant had the highest average F1 score at predicting integrated prophages. Though less balanced in its precision and recall, Kraken2 had the highest average precision by a substantial margin. We introduced the machine learning tool, Phybrid, which demonstrated an improvement in average F1 score over tools such as MetaPhinder. The tool utilizes machine learning with both gene content and nucleotide features. The addition of nucleotide features improves the precision and recall compared to the gene content features alone.Viral identification by all tools was not impacted by underlying read distribution but did improve with contig length. Tool performance was inversely related to taxonomic complexity and varied by the phage host. For instance, Rhizobium and Enterococcus phages were identified consistently by the tools; whereas, Neisseria prophage sequences were commonly missed in this study.CONCLUSION: This study benchmarked the performance of nine state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools to identify viral contigs across different simulation conditions. This study explored the ability of the tools to identify integrated prophage elements traditionally excluded from targeted sequencing approaches. Our comprehensive analysis of viral identification tools to assess their performance in a variety of situations provides valuable insights to viral researchers looking to mine viral elements from publicly available metagenomic data.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,0,3,,,,1471-2105,,MEDLINE:34130621,34130621,

In nature, insertion of T-DNA into the plant genome and its subsequent transfer via sexual reproduction have been shown for several species in the genera Nicotiana, Ipomoea , and Linaria . A sequence homologous to T-DNA of the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes was found in the genome of wild-type Nicotiana glauca (section Noctiflorae) more than 30years ago and was named cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA). It comprises an imperfect inverted repeat and contains homologs of several T-DNA oncogenes (NgrolB, NgrolC, Ngorf13, Ngorf14) and an opine synthesis gene (Ngmis). Multiple cT-DNAs have also been found in species of the sections Tomentosae and Nicotiana of the genus Nicotiana. These ancient cT-DNA genes are still expressed, indicating that they may play a role in the evolution of these plants. In 2012-2013, cT-DNA was detected and characterized in Linaria vulgaris and L. genistifolia ssp. dalmatica. Their cT-DNA is present in two copies and organized as an imperfect direct tandem repeat, containing LvORF2, LvORF3, LvORF8, LvrolA, LvrolB, LvrolC, LvORF13, LvORF14, and the Lvmis genes. In 2015, cT-DNA was found in Ipomoea. Two types of T-DNA-like sequences were described within this genera, and their distribution varied among cultured hexaploid, tetraploid, and wild diploid forms. Thus, several independent T-DNA integration events occurred in the genomes of these three plant genera. We propose that the events of T-DNA insertion in the plant genome might have affected their evolution, resulting in the creation of new plant species.

However, it resulted in a remarkable increase in crop yield but drastically reduced soil fertility; increased the production cost, food prices, and carbon footprints; and depleted the fossil reserves with huge penalties to the environment and ecological sustainability. The groundwater, rivers, and oceans are loaded with N excess which is an environmental catastrophe. Nitrogen emissions (e.g., ammonia, nitrogen oxide, nitrous oxide) play an important role in global climate change and contribute to particulate matter and acid rain causing respiratory problems, cancers, and damage to forests and buildings. Therefore, the nitrogen-polluted planet Earth needs concerted global efforts to avoid the disaster. Improved agricultural N management focuses on the synchronization of crop N demand and N supply along with improving the N-use efficiency of the crops. However, there is very little focus on the natural sources of N available for plants in the form of diazotrophic bacteria present inside or on the root surface and the rhizosphere. These diazotrophs are the mini-nitrogen factories that convert available (78%) atmospheric N2 to ammonia through a process known as biological nitrogen fixation which is then taken up by the plants for its metabolic functioning. Diazotrophs also stimulate root architecture by producing plant hormones and hence improve the plant's overall ability to uptake nutrients and water. In recent years, nanotechnology has revolutionized the whole agri-industry by introducing nano-fertilizers and coated/slow-releasing fertilizers. With this in mind, we tried to explore the following questions: To what extent can the crop N requirements be met by diazotroph inoculation? Can N input to agriculture be managed in a way leading to environmental benefits and farmers saving money? Can nanotechnology help in technological advancement of diazotroph application? The review suggests that an integrated technology based on slow-releasing nano-fertilizer combined with diazotrophs should be adopted to decrease nitrogen inputs to the agricultural system.

Similarly, biomass content was also 1.3 times higher in the transformant strain. No significant difference was observed in endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG) content between both fungal strains, suggesting dissimilar effects of VHb towards different enzymatic productions.

Alternative technologies, such as cisgenesis and genome-editing may address many of such issues and facilitate the development of genetically engineered crop varieties with multiple favourable traits. Genetic engineering and plant transformation have played a pivotal role in crop improvement via introducing beneficial foreign gene(s) or silencing the expression of endogenous gene(s) in crop plants. Genetically modified crops possess one or more useful traits, such as, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, and nutritional improvement. To date, nearly 525 different transgenic events in 32 crops have been approved for cultivation in different parts of the world. The adoption of transgenic technology has been shown to increase crop yields, reduce pesticide and insecticide use, reduce CO2 emissions, and decrease the cost of crop production. However, widespread adoption of transgenic crops carrying foreign genes faces roadblocks due to concerns of potential toxicity and allergenicity to human beings, potential environmental risks, such as chances of gene flow, adverse effects on non-target organisms, evolution of resistance in weeds and insects etc. These concerns have prompted the adoption of alternative technologies like cisgenesis, intragenesis, and most recently, genome editing. Some of these alternative technologies can be utilized to develop crop plants that are free from any foreign gene hence, it is expected that such crops might achieve higher consumer acceptance as compared to the transgenic crops and would get faster regulatory approvals. In this review, we present a comprehensive update on the current status of the genetically modified (GM) crops under cultivation. We also discuss the issues affecting widespread adoption of transgenic GM crops and comment upon the recent tools and techniques developed to address some of these concerns.",,,,,,,,,64,1,1,0,45,0,68,,,,1432-2048,,MEDLINE:32236850,32236850,

This study provides a systematic investigation of physical and chemical surface parameters that influence bacteria capture over lectin-functionalized polymer interfaces and then applies these findings to construct surfaces with significantly enhanced bacteria capture. The designer block copolymer poly(glycidyl methacrylate)- block-poly(vinyldimethyl azlactone) was used as a lectin attachment layer, and lectin coupling into the polymer film through azlactone-lectin coupling reactions was first characterized. Here, experimental parameters including polymer areal chain density, lectin molecular weight, and lectin coupling buffer were systematically varied to identify parameters driving highest azlactone conversions and corresponding lectin surface densities. To introduce physical nanostructures into the attachment layer, nanopillar arrays (NPAs) of varied heights (300 and 2100 nm) were then used to provide an underlying surface template for the functional polymer layer. Capture of Escherichia coli on lectin-polymer surfaces coated over both flat and NPA surfaces was then investigated. For flat polymer interfaces, bacteria were detected on the surface after incubation at a solution concentration of 103 cfu/mL, and a corresponding detection limit of 1.7 * 103 cfu/mL was quantified. This detection limit was 1 order of magnitude lower than control lectin surfaces functionalized with standard, carbodiimide coupling chemistry. NPA surfaces containing 300 nm tall pillars further improved the detection limit to 2.1 * 102 cfu/mL, but also reduced the viability of captured cells. Finally, to investigate the impact of cell surface parameters on capture, we used Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells genetically modified to allow manipulation of exopolysaccharide adhesin production levels. Statistical analysis of surface capture levels revealed that lectin surface density was the primary factor driving capture, as opposed to exopolysaccharide adhesin expression. These findings emphasize the critical importance of the synthetic interface and the development of surfaces that combine high lectin densities with tailored physical features to drive high levels of capture. These insights will aid in design of biofunctional interfaces with physicochemical surface properties favorable for capture and isolation of bacteria cells from solutions.",,,,,,,,,10,1,0,0,4,0,9,,,,1526-4602,,MEDLINE:31150217,31150217,

The expression of Nicotiana benthamiana AGO5 gene (NbAGO5) is highly induced by Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) infection; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we have analyzed the potential promoter activities of NbAGO5 and its interactions with viral proteins by using a 2,000 bp fragment, designated as PN1, upstream to the translation initiation of NbAGO5. PN1 and seven serial 5'-deletion mutants (PN2-PN8) were fused with a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter and introduced into the N. benthamiana genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for further characterization. It was found that PN4-GUS transgenic plants were able to drive strong GUS expression in the whole plant. In the virus infection tests, the GUS activity was strongly induced in PN4-GUS transgenic plants after being challenged with potexviruses. Infiltration of the transgenic plants individually with BaMV coat protein (CP) or triple gene block protein 1 (TGBp1) revealed that only TGBp1 was crucial for inducing the NbAGO5 promoter. To identify the factors responsible for controlling the activity of the NbAGO5 promoter, we employed yeast one-hybrid screening on a transcription factor cDNA library. The result showed that NbNAC42 and NbZFP3 could directly bind the 704 bp promoter regions of NbAGO5. By using overexpressing and virus-induced gene silencing techniques, we found that NbNAC42 and NbZFP3 regulated and downregulated, respectively, the expression of the NbAGO5 gene. Upon virus infection, NbNAC42 played an important role in regulating the expression of NbAGO5.

Moreover, it mainly highlights the history of brucellosis control and prevention in Iran, including eradication programs, vast livestock vaccination programs, and subunit vaccine studies. It also discusses major problems that the country encounters with disease control. In recent years, Persian scientists have focused on evaluating the efficacy of best Brucella immunogens in vivo to introduce a new subunit vaccine. The results of some studies could demonstrate the vaccine potential of some immunogens.",,,,,,,,,45,6,0,0,21,0,53,,,,2008-823X,,MEDLINE:28766326,28766326,

In this chapter we outline a basic A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation method, using 4-day-old cotyledonary explants, that has been successfully applied to a range of different B. oleracea and B. napus genotypes. For demonstration purposes, we focus primarily on the diploid species B. oleracea using a model doubled haploid genotype, AG DH1012. After only 3-4 weeks on kanamycin selection the first transgenic shoots can be isolated. Transformation efficiencies are typically in the region of 15-25 % (based on 15-25 PCR-positive independent shoots from 100 inoculated explants). Most explants will produce multiple shoots (1-3+ per explant) and so the total number of transgenic shoots produced will exceed 15-25 per 100 explant experiment. The protocol is also applicable to B. napus and modifications specific to this species are highlighted accordingly.

Despite the importance of these two pathways, little is known about the mechanism that controls pyrophosphorylase activity or the location of its allosteric sites. Here, we report pyruvate-bound crystal structures of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, identifying a previously elusive activator site for the enzyme. We found that the tetrameric enzyme binds two molecules of pyruvate in a planar conformation. Each binding site is located in a crevice between the C-terminal domains of two subunits where they stack via a distinct beta-helix region. Pyruvate interacts with the side chain of Lys-43 and with the peptide backbone of Ser-328 and Gly-329 from both subunits. These structural insights led to the design of two variants with altered regulatory properties. In one variant (K43A), the allosteric effect was absent, whereas in the other (G329D), the introduced Asp mimicked the presence of pyruvate. The latter generated an enzyme that was preactivated and insensitive to further activation by pyruvate. Our study furnishes a deeper understanding of how glycogen biosynthesis is regulated in bacteria and the mechanism by which transgenic plants increased their starch production. These insights will facilitate rational approaches to enzyme engineering for starch production in crops of agricultural interest and will promote further study of allosteric signal transmission and molecular evolution in this important enzyme family.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,7,0,8,,,,1083-351X,,MEDLINE:30401744,30401744,

In these natural examples of horizontal gene transfer from Agrobacterium to plants, the T-DNA donor is assumed to be a mikimopine strain of A. rhizogenes. A sequence homologous to the T-DNA of the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes was found in the genome of untransformed Nicotiana glauca about 30 years ago, and was named cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA). It represents an imperfect inverted repeat and contains homologs of several T-DNA oncogenes (NgrolB, NgrolC, NgORF13, NgORF14) and an opine synthesis gene (Ngmis). A similar cT-DNA has also been found in other species of the genus Nicotiana. These presumably ancient homologs of T-DNA genes are still expressed, indicating that they may play a role in the evolution of these plants. Recently T-DNA has been detected and characterized in Linaria vulgaris and L. dalmatica. In Linaria vulgaris the cT-DNA is present in two copies and organized as a tandem imperfect direct repeat, containing LvORF2, LvORF3, LvORF8, LvrolA, LvrolB, LvrolC, LvORF13, LvORF14, and the Lvmis genes. All L. vulgaris and L. dalmatica plants screened contained the same T-DNA oncogenes and the mis gene. Evidence suggests that there were several independent T-DNA integration events into the genomes of these plant genera. We speculate that ancient plants transformed by A. rhizogenes might have acquired a selective advantage in competition with the parental species.

CAPRRESI benefits from many strengths of the original plasmid recovery method and introduces restriction enzyme digestion to ease DNA ligation reactions (required for chimera assembly). For this protocol, users clone wildtype genes into the same plasmid (pUC18 or pUC19). After the in silico selection of amino acid sequence regions where chimeras should be assembled, users obtain all the synonym DNA sequences that encode them. Ad hoc Perl scripts enable users to determine all synonym DNA sequences. After this step, another Perl script searches for restriction enzyme sites on all synonym DNA sequences. This in silico analysis is also performed using the ampicillin resistance gene (ampR) found on pUC18/19 plasmids. Users design oligonucleotides inside synonym regions to disrupt wildtype and ampR genes by PCR. After obtaining and purifying complementary DNA fragments, restriction enzyme digestion is accomplished. Chimera assembly is achieved by ligating appropriate complementary DNA fragments. pUC18/19 vectors are selected for CAPRRESI because they offer technical advantages, such as small size (2,686 base pairs), high copy number, advantageous sequencing reaction features, and commercial availability.

As genetic transformation of plants via Agrobacterium has become a routine practice among plant biologists, understanding T-DNA integration remains important for several reasons. First, T-DNA is the final step in one of the unique cases of inter-kingdom horizontal gene transfer in nature. Second, understanding T-DNA integration is important for biotechnological applications. For example, better knowledge of this process may help develop methods to transform species that are currently not susceptible to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In addition, regulatory agencies usually require clean and precise transgenic insertion events, whereas transgenic insertions are commonly complex unpredictable structures. Furthermore, whereas T-DNA integration under natural conditions occurs randomly, technology to direct T-DNA to specific sites in the genome is highly desired. A better understanding of T-DNA integration may help develop methods to achieve more desirable results. Finally, gene targeting methods that require a foreign DNA template for precise DNA modifications in plants often utilize Agrobacterium to deliver the DNA template. Better understanding of the fate of T-DNA in the plant nucleus may help utilize T-DNA for more efficient gene targeting. For introducing gene targeting reagents, efficient delivery of T-DNA without ectopic integration would be useful. The following review summarizes current knowledge related to T-DNA integration.

The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of hyperspectral reflectance measurements of the crop canopy for the assessment of biomass, nitrogen concentration, nitrogen uptake, relative chlorophyll contents, and yield in 2 peanut cultivars, Giza 5 and Giza 6. Peanuts were grown under field conditions and subjected to 3 doses of nitrogen fertilizer with or without the application of 2 bio-fertilizers, Bradyrhizobium spp. or plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. Simple linear regression of normalized difference spectral indices and partial least square regression (PLSR) were employed to develop predictive models to estimate the measured parameters. The tested spectral reflectance indices were significantly related to all measured parameters with R2 of up to 0.89. The spectral reflectance index values differed at the same level of nitrogen fertilizer, as well as among the 3 levels of nitrogen fertilizer application for inoculation with Bradyrhizobium and co-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. The calibration models of PLSR data analysis further improved the results, with R2 values reaching 0.95.

However, a rapid trait testing system for canola requires the development of an efficient transformation and tissue culture system for B. napus-RC. Furthermore, effectiveness of this system needs to be demonstrated by showing that a particular trait can be rapidly introduced into B. napus-RC plants.RESULTS: An in-vitro regeneration protocol was developed for B. napus-RC using 4-day-old cotyledons as the explant. High regeneration percentages, exceeding 70%, were achieved when 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (0.10mg/L), 6-benzylaminopurine (1.0mg/L), gibberellic acid (0.01mg/L) and the ethylene antagonist silver nitrate (5mg/L) were included in the regeneration medium. An average transformation efficiency of 16.4% was obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of B. napus-RC cotyledons using Agrobacterium strain GV3101 harbouring a plasmid with an NPTII (kanamycin-selectable) marker gene and the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN6 (AtACBP6). Transgenic B. napus-RC overexpressing AtACBP6 displayed better tolerance to freezing/frost than the wild type, with enhanced recovery from cellular membrane damage at both vegetative and flowering stages. AtACBP6-overexpressing B. napus-RC plants also exhibited lower electrolyte leakage and improved recovery following frost treatment, resulting in higher yields than the wild type. Ovules from transgenic AtACBP6 lines were better protected from frost than those of the wild type, while the developing embryos of frost-treated AtACBP6-overexpressing plants showed less freezing injury than the wild type.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that B. napus-RC can be successfully regenerated and transformed from cotyledon explants and has the potential to be an effective trait testing platform for canola. Additionally, AtACBP6 shows potential for enhancing cold tolerance in canola however, larger scale studies will be required to further confirm this outcome.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,1746-4811,,,MEDLINE:35546678,35546678,

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in conjunction with two other hemotropic pathogens, Babesia spp. and hemotropic Mycoplasma spp., in tissues and blood samples from 110 dogs with histopathologically diagnosed HSA from throughout the United States. This was a retrospective, observational study using clinical specimens from 110 dogs with HSA banked by the biospecimen repository of the Canine Comparative Oncology and Genomics Consortium. Samples provided for this study from each dog included: fresh frozen HSA tumor tissue (available from n = 100 of the 110 dogs), fresh frozen non-tumor tissue (n = 104), and whole blood and serum samples (n = 108 and 107 respectively). Blood and tissues were tested by qPCR for Bartonella, hemotropic Mycoplasma, and Babesia spp. DNA; serum was tested for Bartonella spp. antibodies. Bartonella spp. DNA was amplified and sequenced from 73% of dogs with HSA (80/110). In contrast, hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. DNA was amplified from a significantly smaller proportion (5%, p<0.0001) and Babesia spp. DNA was not amplified from any dog. Of the 100 HSA tumor samples submitted, 34% were Bartonella PCR positive (32% of splenic tumors, 57% of cardiac tumors, and 17% of other tumor locations). Of 104 non-tumor tissues, 63% were Bartonella PCR positive (56% of spleen samples, 93% of cardiac samples, and 63% of skin/subcutaneous samples). Of dogs with Bartonella positive HSA tumor, 76% were also positive in non-tumor tissue. Bartonella spp. DNA was not PCR amplified from whole blood. This study documented a high prevalence of Bartonella spp. DNA in dogs with HSA from geographically diverse regions of the United States. While 73% of all tissue samples from these dogs were PCR positive for Bartonella DNA, none of the blood samples were, indicating that whole blood samples do not reflect tissue presence of this pathogen.

Herein, we report the presence of the conserved GAG biosynthetic gene cluster in the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii to mediate either similar or unique biological functions. Deletion of the gene cluster disabled fungal ability to produce GAG on germ tubes, mycelia and appressoria. Relative to the wild type strain, null mutant was impaired in topical infection but not injection of insect hosts. We found that GAG production by Metarhizium is partially acetylated and could mediate fungal adherence to hydrophobic insect cuticles, biofilm formation, and penetration of insect cuticles. In particular, it was first confirmed that this exopolymer is responsible for the formation of appressorium mucilage, the essential extracellular matrix formed along with the infection structure differentiation to mediate cell attachment and expression of cuticle degrading enzymes. In contrast to its production during A. fumigatus invasive growth, GAG is not produced on the Metarhizium cells harvested from insect hemocoels; however, the polymer can glue germ tubes into aggregates to form mycelium pellets in liquid culture.

In the present study, the E3 ubiquitin ligase gene AdBiL (Adi3 Binding E3 Ligase) was introduced into tomato line Ailsa Craig via Agrobacterium-mediated method. Transgenic lines were confirmed for integration into the tomato genome using PCR. Transcription of AdBiL in various transgenic lines was determined using real-time PCR.

Here, we extend the transformation-associated recombination cloning and heterologous expression platform for microbial BGCs to include Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts. Using a broad-host-range expression platform, we test the implicit assumption that biosynthetic pathways are more successfully expressed in more closely related heterologous hosts. Cloning and expression of the violacein BGC from Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea 2ta16 revealed robust production in two proteobacterial hosts, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404, but very little production of the antibiotic in various laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, despite their closer phylogenetic relationship. We identified a nonclustered LuxR-type quorum-sensing receptor from P.luteoviolacea 2ta16, PviR, that increases pathway transcription and violacein production in E.coli by 60-fold independently of acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers. Although E.coli harbors the most similar homolog of PviR identified from all of the hosts tested, overexpression of various E.coli transcription factors did not result in a statistically significant increase in violacein production, while overexpression of two A.tumefaciens PviR homologs significantly increased production. Thus, this work not only introduces a new genetic platform for the heterologous expression of microbial BGCs, it also challenges the assumption that host phylogeny is an accurate predictor of host compatibility.IMPORTANCE Although Gram-positive heterologous hosts such as Streptomyces have been developed and optimized to support diverse secondary metabolic reactions, there has been comparatively less work on Gram-negative hosts, some of which grow faster and are easier to work with. This work presents a new genetic platform for direct cloning and broad-host-range heterologous expression of BGCs in Gram-negative proteobacterial expression hosts, and we leverage this platform to uncover regulatory elements that influence violacein expression from Pseudoalteromonas Although it is often assumed that BGCs will be more successfully expressed in more closely related hosts, our work suggests that this may not be a general rule of thumb, as heterologous production of natural products can be influenced by specific host regulatory and/or biosynthetic elements, and the identity and effectiveness of those elements are difficult to predict. We argue for the use of a diverse set of heterologous hosts, which may also provide insights into the BGC biosynthetic mechanism and the biological function of BGCs.",,,,,,,,,36,1,0,0,30,1,36,,,,2150-7511,,MEDLINE:28874475,28874475,

Thus, a full DNA and coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the Pikh gene, 3172 bp, and 1206 bp in length, were obtained through amplifying the gDNA and cDNA template from a PH9-resistant rice variety using a specific primer. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology was also used to introduce the Pikh gene into the MR219 callus.

In its simplest form, TCS-dependent regulation of transcription entails phosphoryl-transfer from a sensory histidine kinase to its cognate DNA-binding receiver protein. However, in certain cases, auxiliary proteins may modulate TCSs in response to secondary environmental cues. Caulobacter crescentus FixT is one such auxiliary regulator. FixT is composed of a single receiver domain and functions as a feedback inhibitor of the FixL-FixJ (FixLJ) TCS, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in adaptation to microaerobiosis. We sought to define the impact of fixT on Caulobacter cell physiology and to understand the molecular mechanism by which FixT represses FixLJ signaling. fixT deletion results in excess production of porphyrins and premature entry into stationary phase, demonstrating the importance of feedback inhibition of the FixLJ signaling system. Although FixT is a receiver domain, it does not affect dephosphorylation of the oxygen sensor kinase FixL or phosphoryl-transfer from FixL to its cognate receiver FixJ. Rather, FixT represses FixLJ signaling by inhibiting the FixL autophosphorylation reaction. We have further identified a 4-cysteine motif in Caulobacter FixT that binds an Fe-S cluster and protects the protein from degradation by the Lon protease. Our data support a model in which the oxidation of this Fe-S cluster promotes the degradation of FixT in vivo This proteolytic mechanism facilitates clearance of the FixT feedback inhibitor from the cell under normoxia and resets the FixLJ system for a future microaerobic signaling event.IMPORTANCE Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are broadly conserved in the bacterial kingdom and generally contain two molecular components, a sensor histidine kinase and a receiver protein. Sensor histidine kinases alter their phosphorylation state in direct response to a physical or chemical cue, whereas receiver proteins receive the phosphoryl group from the kinase to regulate a change in cell physiology. We have discovered that a single-domain receiver protein, FixT, binds an Fe-S cluster and controls Caulobacter heme homeostasis though its function as a negative-feedback regulator of the oxygen sensor kinase FixL. We provide evidence that the Fe-S cluster protects FixT from Lon-dependent proteolysis in the cell and endows FixT with the ability to function as a second, autonomous oxygen/redox sensor in the FixL-FixJ signaling pathway.

Relative water content (RWC), plant height, leaf expansion, finger length and width and grain weight were severely reduced (50-70%), and the flowering period was delayed by 20% in control plants compared to transgenic plants under salinity stress. With increasing salt stress, the proline and chlorophyll contents as well as the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) increased by 25-100% in transgenics, while malondialdehyde (MDA) showed a 2-4-fold decrease. The increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and the reduction in the MDA content suggest efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transgenics and, as a consequence, probably alleviation of salt stress. Also, the leaf tissues of the transgenics accumulated 1.5-2.5-fold higher Na(+) and 0.4-0.8-fold higher K(+) levels. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that overexpression of SbVPPase in transgenic finger millet enhances the plant's performance under salt stress.",,,,,,,,,49,4,0,0,40,0,52,,,,1618-1328,,MEDLINE:24877670,24877670,

Their germination requires exposure to strigolactones (SLs) exuded by the host plant roots. Here we studied genes in the host plant tomato involved in SL exudation and their impact on parasitic weeds. We provide evidence that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis of two homologous ATP-binding cassette subfamily G (ABCG) genes, ABCG44 (Solyc08g067610) and ABCG45 (Solyc08g067620), in tomato significantly reduces SLs in the root exudate and abolishes germination of the root-parasitic weed P. aegyptiaca. Based on genome sequence similarity between ABCG44 and ABCG45, a 20-bp target sequence in their exon region was selected to design single guide RNA targeting both genes using CRISPR/Cas9. The plant binary vector constructs harboring the specific Cas9 and single guide RNA were transformed into tomato. Selected T0 mutated tomato plants showed different types of deletions at both gene loci. Genotype analysis of T1 plants suggested stable inheritance of the introduced mutations without any potential off-target effects. The phenotype of Cas9-mutated plants included increased shoot branching and growth of axillary buds, and reduced length of primary stems. Interestingly, reduced germination of P. aegyptiaca resulted from a decrease in the SL orobanchol in the root exudate of Cas9-mutated plants; however, orobanchol content in the root extract was unchanged compared to control plants. Moreover, in single and double ABCG mutants, expression of the SL-biosynthesis genes CCD8 and MAX1 decreased. The current study offers insights into CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of ABCG genes, which could serve as an efficient control method to prevent root-parasitic weed germination.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,,1618-0860,,MEDLINE:33704586,33704586,

For TMPK from Bacilus anthracis and humans, the effects of Mg2+ and Mn2+ were similar, whereas the effects of other divalent metal ions were different, and no stimulatory effect of Cs+ was observed.

Drought resistance is controlled by multiple genes, and therefore, a multi-gene genetic engineering strategy is theoretically useful for improving drought resistance. However, the experimental evidence for such a strategy is still lacking. In this study, a few drought-responsive genes from rice were assembled by a multiple-round site-specific assembly system, and the constructs were introduced into the rice cultivar KY131 via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic lines of the multi-gene and corresponding single-gene constructs were pre-evaluated for drought resistance. We found that the co-overexpression of two genes, encoding a constitutively active form of a bZIP transcription factor (OsbZIP46CA1) and a protein kinase (SAPK6) involved in the abscisic acid signaling pathway, showed significantly enhanced drought resistance compared with the single-gene transgenic lines and the negative transgenic plants. Single-copy lines of this bi-gene combination (named XL22) and the corresponding single-gene lines were further evaluated for drought resistance in the field using agronomical traits. The results showed that XL22 exhibited greater yield, biomass, spikelet number, and grain number under moderate drought stress conditions. The seedling survival rate of XL22 and the single-gene overexpressors after drought stress treatment also supported the drought resistance results. Furthermore, expression profiling by RNA-Seq revealed that many genes involved in the stress response were specifically up-regulated in the drought-treated XL22 lines and some of the stress-related genes activated in CA1-OE and SAPK6-OE were distinct, which could partially explain the different performances of these lines with respect to drought resistance. In addition, the XL22 seedlings showed improved tolerance to heat and cold stresses.

We used five different cultivars originating from two propagation sites (France, Italy) with different degrees of susceptibility towards R. solani (two susceptible, one moderately tolerant and two cultivars with partial resistance).

In general, cultivar-specific differences in the bacterial communities were more pronounced in seeds than in roots. Seeds of Rhizoctonia-tolerant cultivars contain a higher relative abundance of the genera Paenibacillus, Kosakonia, and Enterobacter, while Gaiellales, Rhizobiales, and Kosakonia were enhanced in responsive rhizospheres.

New, emerging or introduced diseases will continue to cause extensive damage in afflicted areas. Understanding how the vector acquires the pathogen and inoculates new hosts is critical in developing effective management strategies. Management may be an insecticide applied to kill the vector or a host plant resistance mechanism to make the host plant less suitable for the vector. In either case, the tactic must act before the insect performs the key behavior(s) resulting in either acquisition or transmission. This requires knowledge of the timing of behaviors the insect uses to probe the plant and commence ingestion. These behaviors are visualized using electropenetrography (EPG), wherein the plant and insect become part of an electrical circuit. With the tools to define specific steps in the probing process, we can understand the timing of acquisition and inoculation. With that understanding comes the potential for more relevant testing of management strategies, through insecticides or host plant resistance.

The other method uses a direct physical transfer of DNA by means of microinjection, microprojectile bombardment, or polymers such as polyethylene glycol.

At that time the gene expression patterns of host plants differ depending on the Agrobacterium strain, plant species and cell-type used. Later on, integration of the T-DNA into the plant host genome, expression of the encoded oncogenes, and increase in phytohormone levels induce a fundamental reprogramming of the transformed cells. This results in their proliferation and finally formation of plant tumors. The process of reprogramming is accompanied by altered gene expression, morphology and metabolism.

Stable Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation was carried based on the half-seed method (Paz et al. 2006). The integration of the transgene was confirmed from the genomic DNA of transformed soybean plants using PCR and the copy number of transgene was determined by Southern blotting using leaf samples from T2 seedlings. In addition to genomic integration, the expression of the transgenes was analyzed by RT-PCR and most of the transgenic lines expressed the transgenes introduced. The chosen two transgenic lines (line #2 and #9) for further experiment showed the substantial drought stress tolerance by surviving even at the end of the 20-day of drought treatment. And the positive relationship between the levels of AtABF3 gene expression and drought-tolerance was confirmed by qRT-PCR and drought tolerance test. The stronger drought tolerance of transgenic lines seemed to be resulted from physiological changes. Transgenic lines #2 and #9 showed ion leakage at a significantly lower level (P < 0.01) than non-transgenic (NT) control. In addition, the chlorophyll contents of the leaves of transgenic lines were significantly higher (P < 0.01). The results indicated that their enhanced drought tolerance was due to the prevention of cell membrane damage and maintenance of chlorophyll content. Water loss by transpiration also slowly proceeded in transgenic plants. In microscopic observation, higher stomata closure was confirmed in transgenic lines. Especially, line #9 had 56% of completely closed stomata whereas only 16% were completely open. In subsequent salt tolerance test, the apparently enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic lines was measured in ion leakage rate and chlorophyll contents. Finally, the agronomic characteristics of ectopically expressed AtABF3 transgenic plants (T2) compared to NT plants under regular watering (every 4 days) or low rate of watering condition (every 10 days) was investigated. When watered regularly, the plant height of drought-tolerant line (#9) was shorter than NT plants. However, under the drought condition, total seed weight of line #9 was significantly higher than in NT plants (P < 0.01). Moreover, the pods of NT plants showed severe withering, and most of the pods failed to set normal seeds. All the evidences in the study clearly suggested that overexpression of the AtABF3 gene conferred drought and salt tolerance in major crop soybean, especially under the growth condition of low watering.",,,,,,,,,16,2,0,0,11,0,17,,,,0219-1032,,MEDLINE:29754472,29754472,

While their presence is appreciated as game animals, they are also responsible for significant agricultural damage, habitat degradation and water quality issues. In addition, wild boars may harbor ticks and can act as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, thus posing a risk of transmission towards humans and domestic animals. This latter aspect of their veterinary-medical and epidemiological significance has become especially important in recent years, because increasing numbers of wild boars are reported to enter urban areas. Despite of this, reports on tick infestations of wild boars are scarce in Europe. For this study, 333 ixodid ticks were collected from 51 wild boars at 32 peri-urban locations in 14 counties of Hungary, during 2005-2008 (older samples) and 2019-2020 (new samples). Five species of ticks were identified: Dermacentor reticulatus (n=165), Ixodes ricinus (n=90) and Haemaphysalis concinna (n=29) in both sample groups, while H. inermis (n=29) and D. marginatus (n=20) were only found among the old samples. The seasonality of collected ticks corresponded to their known activities. After DNA extraction, ticks were screened for three groups of tick-borne pathogens. All samples were negative for brucellae, recently reported to be carried and transmitted transovarially by D. marginatus. Four D. reticulatus contained Babesia canis DNA, while in one H. concinna nymph the recently discovered zoonotic B. cf. crassa (reported in Slovenia within 80 km of our sampling site) was detected. In addition, Anaplasma phagocytophilum was identified in D. reticulatus (n=1), H. concinna (n=3) and in its known vector, I. ricinus (n=15). Phylogenetically, three out of four A. phagocytophilum genotypes clustered with zoonotic ones. In conclusion, despite of the high prevalence of Brucella suis in wild boars in Hungary, no evidence was found in support of the epidemiological role of ticks in transmitting brucellae. On the other hand, wild boars might introduce B. canis-carrier D. reticulatus into urban areas, unlike birds (which are not known to carry this tick species in the country). Most importantly, tick-infested wild boars can contribute to the spread of a novel zoonotic Babesia sp. and of the zoonotic variants of A. phagocytophilum.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1877-9603,,MEDLINE:35306450,35306450,

For rhizobia in legume root nodules, diverting resources from nitrogen fixation to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) has been discussed as a source of host-symbiont conflict. Yet, little is known about natural variation in PHB storage and its implications for rhizobial evolution. We therefore measured phenotypic variation in natural rhizobia populations and investigated how PHB might contribute to fitness in the free-living stage. We found that natural populations of rhizobia from Glycine max and Chamaecrista fasciculata had substantial, heritable variation in PHB acquisition during symbiosis. A model simulating temperature-dependent metabolic activity showed that the observed range of stored PHB per cell could support survival for a few days, for active cells, or over a century for sufficiently dormant cells. Experiments with field-isolated Bradyrhizobium in starvation culture suggest PHB is partitioned asymmetrically in dividing cells, consistent with individual-level bet-hedging previously demonstrated in E. meliloti. High-PHB isolates used more PHB over the first month, yet still retained more PHB for potential long-term survival in a dormant state. These results suggest that stored resources like PHB may support both short-term and long-term functions that contribute to fitness in the free-living stage.",,,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,0,10,,,2054-5703,,,MEDLINE:30662731,30662731,

We present a protocol for high-throughput Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Penium margaritaceum, a unicellular CGA species. The versatility of Penium as a model for studying various aspects of plant cell biology and development was illustrated through non-invasive visualization of protein localization and dynamics in living cells.

This provided evidence supporting current models of cell wall assembly and inter-polymer interactions that were based on studies of land plants, but in this case using direct observation in vivo.

Recent studies have identified pyrabactin resistance (PYR) 1/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory component of ABA receptor (RCAR) proteins as an ABA receptor that interacts with the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) family. Here, we examined the functional involvement of ABA signaling components in pre- and post-invasive defense responses of Arabidopsis against the virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Overexpression of the ABA receptor, RCAR3, enhanced susceptibility to Pst DC3000 by suppressing callose deposition and induction of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, such as PR1 and NPR1, after syringe infiltration. In contrast, a dip inoculation assay revealed that RCAR3-overexpression mutants inhibited stomatal reopening during Pst DC3000 infection and coronatine (COR) treatment, leading to enhanced resistance to Pst DC3000, which was not accompanied by differential expression of PR1 and NPR1 genes. As a negative regulator of ABA signaling, PP2CA interacted with RCAR3 and its loss-of-function and overexpression mutants revealed that ABA sensitivity was positively correlated with stomatal immunity, similar to RCAR3 overexpression mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that RCAR3- and PP2CA-mediated ABA signaling antagonistically or synergistically contributes to the plant immune system throughout different phases of Pst DC3000 attack by SA or COR signaling cross-talk.",,,,,,,,,53,4,0,0,49,0,55,,,,1471-9053,,MEDLINE:25063782,25063782,

We propose an attract-and-kill strategy using a trap crop as an alternative to vector control to reduce transmission of the pathogen, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'. We evaluated vector response to phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus trees using virus-induced gene silencing technology. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was used to produce a phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus (CTV-tPDS) that expresses visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues to attract D. citri. We found that D. citri were more attracted to CTV-tPDS plants with noticeably better fecundity and overall population fitness than on control plants. Moreover, rearing D. citri on CTV-tPDS plants significantly increased their survival probability compared with those reared on control plants. CTV-tPDS plants possessed reduced content of both carotenoid and chlorophyll pigments resulting in a consistent photobleached phenotype on citrus leaves which provided a sufficient close-range visual attractant to stimulate D. citri landing. Additionally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which offered adequate olfactory cues to attract psyllid from long-range. Finally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched metabolite content of phloem sap and leaves which offered appropriate gustatory cues that influenced probing/feeding behavior. We believe that introducing CTV-tPDS plants (as a trap crop) to D. citri-infested orchards will attract and congregate psyllids to facilitate their removal from the target crop with insecticides or by other means. This new strategy could be deployed relatively quickly and economically to HLB-impacted citrus industries.

The identification of host-Brucella interaction is crucial to understand host immunity against Brucella infection and Brucella pathogenesis against host immune responses.

Many text-mining systems for extracting gene and protein interactions have been proposed. However, only a few of them have been designed by considering the peculiarities of host-pathogen interactions. In this paper, we used a text mining approach for extracting host-Brucella gene-gene interactions from the abstracts of articles in PubMed. The gene-gene interactions here represent the interactions between genes and/or gene products (e.g., proteins). The SciMiner tool, originally designed for detecting mammalian gene/protein names in text, was extended to identify host and Brucella gene/protein names in the abstracts. Next, sentence-level and abstract-level co-occurrence based approaches, as well as sentence-level machine learning based methods, originally designed for extracting intra-species gene interactions, were utilized to extract the interactions among the identified host and Brucella genes. The extracted interactions were manually evaluated. A total of 46 host-Brucella gene interactions were identified and represented as an interaction network. Twenty four of these interactions were identified from sentence-level processing. Twenty two additional interactions were identified when abstract-level processing was performed. The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) was used to represent the identified interaction types at a hierarchical ontology structure.

To fully access the plant tissue microbiome, the extracted plant mDNA should allow optimal PCR applications and the genetic content must be representative of the total microbial diversity. In this study, we evaluated the endophytic bacterial diversity retrieved using different mDNA extraction procedures. Metagenomic DNA from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) stem and root tissues were extracted using two classical DNA extraction protocols (CTAB- and SDS-based) and five commercial kits. The mDNA yields and quality as well as the reproducibility were compared. 16S rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) was used to assess the impact on endophytic bacterial community structures observed. Generally, the classical protocols obtained high mDNA yields from sorghum tissues; however, they were less reproducible than the commercial kits. Commercial kits retrieved higher quality mDNA, but with lower endophytic bacterial diversities compared to classical protocols. The SDS-based protocol enabled access to the highest sorghum endophytic diversities. Therefore, SDS-extracted sorghum root and stem microbiome diversities were analysed via 454 pyrosequencing, and this revealed that the two tissues harbour significantly different endophytic communities. Nevertheless, both communities are dominated by agriculturally important genera such as Microbacterium, Agrobacterium, Sphingobacterium, Herbaspirillum, Erwinia, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas; which have previously been shown to play a role in plant growth promotion. This study shows that DNA extraction protocols introduce biases in culture-independent studies of environmental microbial communities by influencing the mDNA quality, which impacts the microbial diversity analyses and evaluation. Using the broad-spectrum SDS-based DNA extraction protocol allows the recovery of the most diverse endophytic communities associated with sorghum tissues and, as such, establishes a reliable basis for future study of endophytic communities.",,,,,,,,,45,2,0,0,39,0,48,,,,1872-8359,,MEDLINE:25775938,25775938,

Here, we introduced synonymous substitutions to the codon C574G575C576 coding conserved residue arginine at position 192 (R192) of tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV) CP. Substitution of the codon C574G575C576 to A574G575A576 or A574G575G576, but not C574G575A576, C574G575T576, or C574G575G576, reduced the replication, cell-to-cell movement, and accumulation of TVBMV in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, suggesting that C574 was critical for replication of TVBMV.

Synonymous substitutions disrupting base pairs C576-G531 and C534-G573 did not affect viral accumulation.

Dendrobium officinale is a special orchid species that can grow without seed vernalization. Because the whole-genome sequence of D. officinale is publicly available, this species is poised to become a convenient research model for the evolutionary, developmental, and genetic studies of Orchidaceae. Despite these advantages, the methods of genetic manipulation are poorly developed in D. officinale. In this study, based on the previously developed Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system, we identified several highly efficient promoters for exogenous gene expression and successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for editing endogenous genes in the genome of D. officinale. These two basic techniques contribute to the genetic manipulation toolbox of Orchidaceae. The pCambia-1301-35SN vector containing the CaMV 35S promoter and the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and Superfolder green fluorescence protein (SG) as reporter genes were introduced into the plant tissues by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Fluorescence emission from the transformed plants confirmed the successful transcription and translation of SG genes into functional proteins. We compared the GUS activity under different promoters including four commonly used promoters (MtHP, CVMV, MMV and PCISV) with CaMV 35S promoter and found that MMV, CVMV, and PCISV were as effective as the 35S promoter. Furthermore, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system successfully in D. officinale. By selecting five target genes (C3H, C4H, 4CL, CCR, and IRX) in the lignocellulose biosynthesis pathway, we showed that, for a given target, this system can generate edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) at a rate of 10 to 100%. These results showed that our two genetic manipulation tools can efficiently express exogenous genes and edit endogenous genes in D. officinale.

Finally, the stocking density of grass carp and the yield per unit area of pond could be increased without reducing the growth rate.",,,,,,,,,4,1,0,0,5,0,6,,,2167-8359,,,MEDLINE:31632857,31632857,

We developed a defined minimal Model Lignocellulose growth medium for reproducible coculture experiments. We demonstrated that the formaldehyde produced by P. putida growing on vanillic acid can exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration for C. fimi, and, furthermore, that the presence of M. extorquens lowers those concentrations. We also uncovered unexpected ecological dynamics, including resource competition, and interspecies differences in growth requirements and toxin sensitivities. Finally, we introduced the possibility for a mutualistic interaction between C. fimi and M. extorquens through metabolite exchange.

The identification of genes involved in mechanisms targeted to cope with water shortage is an essential and indispensable task for improving the drought and salt tolerance of soybean. One of the approaches for obtaining lines with increased tolerance is genetic modification. The dehydration-responsive element binding proteins (DREBs), belonging to the AP2 family, are trans-active transcription factors that bind to the cis-sequences of the promoter for activating the expression of the target genes that mediate drought and salt tolerant responses. In this study, the GmDREB6 transgene was introduced into DT84 cultivar soybean plants, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The efficacy of GmDREB6 overexpression in enhancing the transcriptional level of GmP5CS and proline accumulation in genetically modified (GM) soybean plants was also assayed. The results demonstrated that ten GM soybean plants (T0 generation) were successfully generated from the transformed explants after selecting with kanamycin. Among these plantlets, the presence of the GmDREB6 transgene was confirmed in nine plants by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and eight plants showed positive results in Southern blot. In the T1 generation, four GM lines, labelled T1-2, T1-4, T1-7, and T1-10, expressed the recombinant GmDREB6 protein. In the T2 generation, the transcriptional levels of the GmP5CS gene were higher in the GM lines than in the non-transgenic plants, under normal conditions and also under conditions of salt stress and drought, ranging from 1.36 to 2.01 folds and 1.58 to 3.16 folds that of the non-transgenic plants, respectively. The proline content was higher in the four GM soybean lines, T2-2, T2-4, T2-7, and T2-10 than in the non-transgenic plants, ranging from 0.82 mumol/g to 4.03 mumol/g. The proline content was the highest in the GM T2-7 line (7.77 mumol/g). In GM soybean lines, T2-2, T2-4, T2-7, and T2-10 proline content increased after plants were subjected to salt stress for seven days, in comparison to that under normal conditions, and ranged from 247.83% to 300%, while that of the non-GM plants was 238.22%.

Following genetic improvement of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and realization of its potential as a multiple-use species, it was introduced into India in 1980 under an international cooperation effort with support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). It has since spread across the country as a panacea for rural needs of fuel wood, small timber and cattle forage. The paper industry has found that it has potential as raw material for paper making.

This case study describes the leucaena farm forestry plantation program initiated by JK Paper Ltd, Unit CPM (Central Pulp Mills). The unit, under its agroforestry and farm forestry plantation approach, planted leucaena plantations in 2009-2010 in parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh States. To motivate farmers in the mill’s catchment area, and to build confidence in on-farm plantations, exposure visits were arranged to Andhra Pradesh, where huge tracts of agricultural land were under leucaena plantations. As a result, to date, this unit has engaged >7,800 farmers who have established leucaena plantations covering an area of >18,400 ha. A robust plantation R&D network addressed issues such as seed treatment, seed germination, rhizobial inoculation, geometry of plantations, agro-forestry models, selection and development of high production clones, establishment of clonal seed orchards, genetic improvement through mutation techniques and hybridization programs for wood quality improvement.","Resumen India es uno de los principales productores/consumidores de productos de papel y de pulpa de papel (3-4% del total mundial).

Stored product mites (Astigmata) often establish large populations in various types of food items, damaging the food by direct feeding and introducing contaminants, including their own bodies, allergen-containing feces, and associated microorganisms. Here we access the microbial structure and abundance in rearing diets, eggs, feces fraction, and mite bodies of 16 mite populations belonging to three species (Carpoglyphus lactis, Acarus siro, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae) using quantitative PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing. The mite microbiomes had a complex structure dominated by the following bacterial taxa (OTUs): (a) intracellular symbionts of the genera Cardinium and Wolbachia in the mite bodies and eggs; (b) putative gut symbionts of the genera Solitalea, Bartonella, and Sodalis abundant in mite bodies and also present in mite feces; (c) feces-associated or environmental bacteria of the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Kocuria in the diet, mite bodies, and feces. Interestingly and counterintuitively, the differences between microbial communities in various conspecific mite populations were higher than those between different mite species. To explain some of these differences, we hypothesize that the intracellular bacterial symbionts can affect microbiome composition in mite bodies, causing differences between microbial profiles. Microbial profiles differed between various sample types, such as mite eggs, bodies, and the environment (spent growth medium-SPGM). Low bacterial abundances in eggs may result in stochastic effects in parent-offspring microbial transmission, except for the intracellular symbionts. Bacteria in the rearing diet had little effect on the microbial community structure in SPGM and mite bodies. Mite fitness was positively correlated with bacterial abundance in SPGM and negatively correlated with bacterial abundances in mite bodies. Our study demonstrates critical host-microbe interactions, affecting all stages of mite growth and leading to alteration of the environmental microbiome. Correlational evidence based on absolute quantitation of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies suggests that mite-associated microorganisms are critical for modulating important pest properties of mites by altering population growth.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,,1432-184X,,MEDLINE:32852571,32852571,

Moreover, data pertaining to the epizootiological characteristics and geographical origin of B.canis on a nationwide scale are limited, and the risk to public safety posed by B.canis infections is unknown. The MLVA (multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis) assay can be helpful to analyse epidemiological correlations among Brucella isolates and to track their geographic origins. To accomplish this task, MLVA-16 was used to analyse the epidemiological links of 63 isolates obtained from dogs and humans. Sixty-three B.canis strains were sorted into three large clusters (A, B and C) and 50 different genotypes (GT1-50), and 43 unique genotypes were represented by single isolates, suggesting that these strains had no obvious epidemiological links and that canine brucellosis is predominantly sporadic in China. The other seven shared genotypes (among a total of 20 isolates) were each represented by two to eight isolates, indicating that strains from each shared genotype were epidemiologically correlated. Five of the shared genotypes were from 16 strains obtained from Beijing, indicating that canine brucellosis in Beijing originates from multipoint outbreaks with multiple sources of infection. Based on comprehensive case analysis of clinical B.canis infection, we preliminarily suggest that human B.canis infections are associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that results in decreased patient immunity. B.canis may have limited epidemiological significance for the healthy population, but it remains a significant threat to the canine breeding industry and to humans who come into close contact with dogs.

This pathogen can pose serious health concerns and cause severe economic losses due to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on permissible levels of aflatoxins in food and feed. Although biocontrol has yielded some successes in managing aflatoxin contamination, enhancing crop resistance is still the preferred choice of management for long-term sustainability. Hence, host induced gene silencing (HIGS) strategy was explored in this study. The A. flavus gene aflM encoding versicolorin dehydrogenase, a key enzyme involved in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway, was selected as a possible target for suppression through HIGS. An RNAi vector containing a portion of the aflM gene was constructed and introduced into immature B104 maize zygotic embryos through Agrobacterium transformation. PCR analysis of the genomic DNA from T0 leaf tissue confirmed the presence of the transgene in six out of the seven events. The seeds from the lines that showed reduced aflatoxin production in laboratory aflatoxin kernel screening assay (KSA) have been increased from T1 to T4 generation in the past four years. Changes in aflatoxin resistance in these transgenic kernels have been evaluated under both field and laboratory conditions. The T2 generation kernels containing the transgene from two events out of four examined had less aflatoxin (P ≤ 0.01 and P ≤ 0.08) than those without the transgene. Field-inoculated homozygous T3 and T4 transgenic kernels also revealed lower levels of aflatoxins (P ≤ 0.04) than kernels from the null (segregated non-transgenic samples) or B104 controls. A similar result was observed when the harvested T3 and T4 homozygous transgenic kernels were evaluated under KSA conditions without inoculation (P ≤ 0.003-0.05). These two events were crossed with LH195, LH197, LH210, and PHW79 elite breeding lines and the resulting crosses supported less aflatoxin (P ≤ 0.02) than the crosses made with non-transgenic lines. In addition, significantly higher levels of aflM gene-specific small RNAs were detected in the transgenic leaf and kernel tissues, indicating that the enhanced aflatoxin resistance in the homozygous transgenic kernels is likely due to suppression of aflM expression through HIGS.",,,,,,,,,14,1,0,0,10,0,15,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:32411110,32411110,

The limits of this knowledge became evident from our earlier in-depth sorghum transcriptome study showing that over 40% of its transcriptome had not been annotated. Here, we describe a full spectrum of tools to engineer, edit, annotate and characterize sorghum's genes. Efforts to develop those tools began with a morphogene-assisted transformation (MAT) method that led to accelerated transformation times, nearly half the time required with classical callus-based, non-MAT approaches. These efforts also led to expanded numbers of amenable genotypes, including several not previously transformed or historically recalcitrant. Another transformation advance, termed altruistic, involved introducing a gene of interest in a separate Agrobacterium strain from the one with morphogenes, leading to plants with the gene of interest but without morphogenes. The MAT approach was also successfully used to edit a target exemplary gene, phytoene desaturase.

Chromatin isolation by RNA purification profiling and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that GhDAN1 RNA can bind with DNA fragments containing AAAG motifs, similar to DNA binding with one zinc finger transcription factor binding sequences. The suppression of GhDAN1 mainly regulates genes with AAAG motifs in auxin-response pathways, which are associated with drought stress regulation. As a result, GhDAN1-silenced plants exhibit improved tolerance to drought stress. This phenotype resembles the drought-tolerant phenotype of the A-diploid cotton ancestor species, which has an undetectable expression of DAN1.

Genome editing can be used for a multitude of applications, including the partial functional characterization of genes, the production of transgenic organisms and the development of diagnostic tools. Compared to previously available gene editing strategies, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been shown to be easy to establish in new species and boasts high efficiency and specificity. The primary reason for this is that the editing tool uses an RNA molecule to target the gene or sequence of interest, making target molecule design straightforward, given that standard base pairing rules can be exploited.

L. asiaticus' strains formed four prophage typing groups (PTGs): PTG1, with type 1 prophage only (strains from Anaheim, San Gabriel, and Riverside); PTG2, with type 2 prophage only (strains from Hacienda Heights); PTG1-3, with both type 1 and 3 prophages (a strain from Cerritos); and PTG1-2, with both type 1 and type 2 prophages (a strain from La Habra). Analyses of the terL sequence showed that all California 'Ca. L. asiaticus' strains were not introduced from Florida but likely from locations in Asia. Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements were found in all 'Ca. L. asiaticus' strains, yet, a jumping-out event was detected in the 'Ca. L. asiaticus' strain from Cerritos. Altogether, this study demonstrated that the NGS approach focusing on prophage variation was sensitive and effective in revealing diversity of 'Ca.

Therefore, we aimed to optimize the glyphosate tolerance trait in rapeseed via endogenous EPSPS modification. To achieve effective gene replacement in B. napus L., we employed a CRISPR/Cas9 system expressing single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) cleaved by the CRISPR-associated RNA endoribonuclease Csy4 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for targeted induction of double-strand breaks. Both the donor template and a geminiviral replicon harbouring an sgRNA expression cassette were introduced into plant cells. Using sgRNAs targeting adjacent donor DNA template containing synonymous mutations in sgRNA sites, we achieved precise gene replacements in the endogenous B. napus EPSPS gene, BnaC04EPSPS, resulting in amino acid substitutions at frequencies up to 20%. Rapeseed seedlings harbouring these substitutions were glyphosate-tolerant. Furthermore, modifications in BnaC04EPSPS were precisely transmitted to the next generation.

We used embryonic calli for transformation, and plants were regenerated through somatic embryogenesis. In this study, we optimized the incubation time for Agrobacterium infection, the co-cultivation time, the hygromycin concentration for selection, and the callus growth conditions after selection. Our strategy reduced the time required to obtain transgenic plants from 7.6 months to 6.1 months. The expression of GFP-tagged AcWRKY28 was observed in the nuclei of transgenic pineapple root cells.

However, the limited availability of promoter sequences that are uniquely active in specific tissue-types and/or at specific times often precludes co-expression of multiple transgenes in precisely controlled developmental contexts. Here, we developed a system for use in rice that comprises synthetic designer transcription activator-like effectors (dTALEs) and cognate synthetic TALE-activated promoters (STAPs). The system allows multiple transgenes to be expressed from different STAPs, with the spatial and temporal context determined by a single promoter that drives expression of the dTALE. We show that two different systems-dTALE1-STAP1 and dTALE2-STAP2-can activate STAP-driven reporter gene expression in stable transgenic rice lines, with transgene transcript levels dependent on both dTALE and STAP sequence identities. The relative strength of individual STAP sequences is consistent between dTALE1 and dTALE2 systems but differs between cell-types, requiring empirical evaluation in each case. dTALE expression leads to off-target activation of endogenous genes but the number of genes affected is substantially less than the number impacted by the somaclonal variation that occurs during the regeneration of transformed plants. With the potential to design fully orthogonal dTALEs for any genome of interest, the dTALE-STAP system thus provides a powerful approach to fine-tune the expression of multiple transgenes, and to simultaneously introduce different synthetic circuits into distinct developmental contexts.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1467-7652,,MEDLINE:35639605,35639605,

Next Generation Sequencing was used to assess miRNA expression profiles in Brucella-positive and Brucella-negative blood sera; dysregulated miRNAs in blood serum and vaginal fluids were validated using RT-qPCR. ROC curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs for Brucella. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were exploited to investigate the biological functions of dysregulated miRNAs. The results showed that 20 miRNAs were modulated, of which, 12 were upregulated and 8 were downregulated. These findings were corroborated by RT-qPCR, and ROC curves indicated that the miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for Brucella.

It is recognized that S.scabies regulates its pathogenicity via gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)-dependent quorum sensing (QS) signalling. AttM, from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 strain, has recently been proposed to have GBL-assimilative capacity. Here, we presented the introduction of A.tumefaciens-derived attM gene into S.scabies using the Escherichia coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pIJ8600 via intergeneric conjugation, followed by the investigation of secondary metabolism (mycelium growth, TXT production and pathogenicity) in S.scabies attM exconjugants (S.s/attM) in comparison with their wild-type parent strain (S.s/WT). Among the resultant S.s/attM exconjugants, attM was found to be integrated into S.scabies chromosome as analysed by Southern blotting. Moreover, S.s/attM failed to evoke the disease symptoms in planta and displayed altered morphological differentiation in contrast to S.s/WT. The abolishment of TXT production in S.s/attM substantiated the loss of pathogenicity and also implied that attM, when constitutively expressed in S.scabies, could paralyse its GBL signalling pathway. Altogether, lactonase-coding gene attM would be useful in a quorum quenching strategy for plant protection via suppressing TXT production and pathogenicity of S.scabies.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides an efficient means to introduce the lactonase gene attM from Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Streptomyces scabies for evaluating the role of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) in thaxtomin A production and pathogenicity, etc. Our results showed that pathogenicity was abrogated in attM-expressing S.scabies exconjugants. Although there are gene knockout approaches to inactivating GBL signalling and thus pathogenicity in S.scabies, they are not only time consuming due to refractory host but also possibly incomplete in view of gene redundancy.

In 2006, a study of the variability of TYLCV in DO revealed that TYLCV-IL[DO] was associated with all samples of tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) tested and, thus, that the virus had been genetically stable for >15 years (2). However, in 2010 and 2011, 2 of 10 and 11 of 18 samples of TYLC, respectively, were negative for TYLCV infection based upon PCR with the TYLCV-specific primer pair, 2560v (5'-GAGAACAATTGGGATATG-3')/1480c (5'-AATCATGGATTCACGCAC-3'), which directs the amplification of a ~1.7 kb fragment. In 2011, two such samples from the Azua Valley were tested by PCR with the 1470v (5'-AGTGATGAGTTCCCCTGTGC-3')/UPC2 primer pair (1), and sequence analysis of the ~0.4 kb fragment amplified from both samples revealed infection with the mild strain of TYLCV (TYLCV-Mld). A primer specific for TYLCV-Mld was designed (2070v, 5'-AAACGGAGAAATATATAAGGAGCC-3'), and PCR with the 2070v/1480c primer pair directed the amplification of the expected ~2.1 kb fragment from all 11 TYLC samples collected in 2011 that were PCR-negative for TYLCV-IL[DO] infection. Sequence analyses confirmed these were TYLCV-Mld fragments. The complete TYLCV-Mld genome was amplified from two samples from the Azua Valley with Templiphi, the amplified DNA products digested with Sal I, and the resulting ~2.8 kb fragments ligated into Sal I-digested pGEM-11. The complete sequences of these isolates were 2,791 nt and 99% identical to each other and 98% identical to sequences of TYLCV-Mld isolates. The TYLCV-Mld isolates from the DO were designated TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:01:2011 (KJ913682) and TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:02:2011 (KJ913683). A multimeric clone of TYLCV-Mld:DO:TY5:01:2011 was generated in the binary vector pCAMBIA1300 by cloning a 2.2 kb Sal I-EcoRI fragment containing the intergenic region to generate a 0.8-mer (pCTYMld0.8), and then the full-length Sal I fragment was cloned into the Sal I site of pCTYMld0.8 to generate a 1.8-mer (pCTYMldDO-01-1.8). Tomato plants agroinoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pCTYMldDO-01-1.8 developed severe TYLC disease symptoms 10 to 14 days after inoculation, whereas plants inoculated with a strain carrying the empty vector did not develop symptoms. Samples of processing tomatoes with TYLC were collected in 2012 to 2014 in the DO and tested for TYLCV-IL[DO] and TYLCV-Mld by PCR with the 2560v/1480c and 2070v/1480c primers pairs, respectively; these samples had infections of 93% (13/14), 86% (18/21), and 61% (11/18) with TYLCV-Mld; 29% (4/14), 19% (4/21), and 56% (10/18) with TYLCV-IL[DO]; and 21% (3/14), 5% (1/21), and 28% (5/18) with both viruses, respectively. These results reveal that there has been a striking population shift in the begomovirus causing TYLC in the DO, with TYLCV-Mld becoming predominant. This may reflect selection pressure(s) favoring a small pre-existing population of TYLCV-Mld, such as new tomato varieties, or a recent introduction event, such as that described in Venezuela (4).

Wild pigs are reservoirs for pathogens of concern to domestic animals and humans. Exposure to porcine parvovirus, transmissible gastroenteritis, and Leptospira interrogans has been documented in domestic swine but data from wild pigs are lacking. The close proximity of humans, domestic animals, and wild pigs, combined with the liberal hunting of wild pigs, results in frequent opportunities for pathogen transmission. From February-March 2015, blood, tissue and ectoparasite samples were collected from 47 wild pigs. Serologic testing found exposure to Brucella spp. (2%), Toxoplasma gondii (11%), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (13%), porcine circovirus type 2 (36%), pseudorabies virus (64%), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (93%), Lawsonia intracellularis (93%), and porcine parvovirus (94%). Eleven (24%) samples had low titers (1:100) to Leptospira interrogans serovars Bratislava (n=6), Icterohaemorrhagiae (n=6), Pomona (n=2), and Hardjo (n=1). Kidney samples from nine pigs with Leptospira antibodies were negative for Leptospira antigens. Numerous pigs had Metastrongylus lungworms and three had Stephanurus dentatus. Lice (Hematopinus suis) and ticks (Amblyomma breviscutatum) were also detected. No antibodies to Influenza A viruses were detected. In contrast to the previous domestic swine survey, we found evidence of numerous pathogens in wild pigs including new reports of pseudorabies virus, PRRS virus, Brucella, and Leptospira in pigs on Guam.

Aided by the newly published wheat genome sequence, the T-DNA insertion sites in GLRW-3 and GLRW-8 were elucidated at base-pair resolution. While the T-DNA in GLRW-3 inserted in an intergenic region, that of GLRW-8 inactivated an endogenous gene, which was thus excluded from further analysis. Compared to wild -type (WT) control, GLRW-1, -3 and -5 showed decreased LOX gene expression, lower LOX activity and less lipid peroxidation in the grains; they also exhibited significantly higher germination rates and better seedling growth after artificial ageing treatment. Interestingly, the three GLRW lines also had substantially increased contents of several fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid and linolenic acid) in their grain and flour samples than WT control. Collectively, our data suggest that suppression of grain LOX activity can be employed to improve the storability and fatty acid content of wheat seeds and that the MFTID line GLRW-3 is likely of commercial value.

In this study, the G2-aroA gene which provides glyphosate tolerance was split into an N-terminal and a C-terminal region, which were then fused to intein N and intein C of the Ssp DnaE intein, ultimately forming EPSPSn:In and Ic:EPSPSc fusion genes, respectively.

The transgenic tomato displayed much greater anthocyanin accumulation than wild type in all plant organs, but the organs were not fully purple in color except for the stamen. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and an anthocyanin-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene SlAN1 was significantly increased in the transgenic line, suggesting that ectopic expression of AtPAP2 increases the expression of anthocyanin-related structural and regulatory genes to enhance anthocyanin content. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the endogenous MYB protein SlAN2 interacted with two putative bHLH partners, SlAN1 and SlJAF13, while AtPAP2 only interacted with SlJAF13, which may be why AtPAP2 transgenic plants showed limited anthocyanin accumulation in fruits. In addition to anthocyanin accumulation, the transgenic tomato plants were significantly smaller in size, and the length of primary roots and number of lateral roots were obviously decreased. The expression of lignin biosynthetic genes was downregulated in transgenic tomato plants, which may be the reason for the inhibited growth. The lateral organ boundaries-domain (LBD) genes, which regulate lateral root organogenesis in the auxin signaling pathway, were downregulated in transgenic tomato roots, which may partly account for the disturbed lateral root formation in the transformants.

The study showed that 2-3 years after the trials had been organised, more than 90% of the farmers who had participating in the trial activities and were given a seed-input package with 1-5 kg of legume seed had shared this seed, on average with four other farmers. The farmers who received this seed from these directly involved farmers shared their seed less frequently. Eighty per cent of all the seed sharings were of 1-2 kg of seed given as a gift. Only 5% of the sharings involved a cash transaction. More than half of the seed sharings were with family members and around a third were between friends. Men shared at least as often as women and both men and women shared most with persons of their own sex. Information about rhizobium as an associated input for soya was shared by more than one-third of farmers, almost exclusively by farmers who had participated in the demonstration trials themselves. Extrapolation of data suggest that in addition to the 250,000 farmers who participated directly in the N2Africa demonstration trials, another 1,400,000 farmers may have received seed of a new legume crop or variety.

Traditionally, japonica varieties were planted mainly in mid latitudes in the northeast plain and Yangtze River region. The key obstacle for introducing elite mid-latitude japonica varieties to low latitudes is the severe shortening of growth period of the japonica varieties due to their sensitivity to low-latitude short photoperiod and high temperature. Here we report development of new japonica rice with prolonged basic vegetative growth (BVG) periods for low latitudes by targeted editing the Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene.

When planting at low-latitude stations, the frame-shift homozygous lines exhibited significantly longer BVG periods compared with wild-types. Interestingly, we observed that minor deletion of the first few residues within the receiver domain could quantitatively impair the function of Ehd1 on activation of Hd3a and RFT1, resulting in an intermediate-long BVG period phenotype in the homozygous in-frame deletion ehd1 lines. Field investigation further showed that, both the in-frame and frame-shift lines exhibited significantly improved yield potential compared with wild-types.

The 6-8 leaf hybrid plants showed tolerance of 2000 ppm glyphosate in field spraying. These results indicated that functional EPSPS protein was reassembled in vivo by intein-mediated trans-splicing in 100% of plants.

Additionally, overexpressing GmUGT produced soybean varieties that were more sensitive to H. armigera and S. litura. Both mutant and overexpressing lines exhibited no obvious phenotypic changes. The difference in metabolites and gene expression suggested that GmUGT is involved in imparting resistance to leaf-chewing insects by altering the flavonoid content and expression patterns of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and defense.

The three most important soybean producers are Argentina, Brazil, and United States, where soybean crops are routinely inoculated with symbiotic N2-fixing Bradyrhizobium spp. This extended inoculation gave rise to soybean-nodulating allochthonous populations (SNAPs) that compete against new inoculant for nodulation, thus impairing yield responses. Competitiveness depends on intrinsic factors contributed by genotype, extrinsic ones determined by growth and environmental conditions, and strain persistence in the soil. To assess these factors in Argentinean SNAPs, we studied 58 isolates from five sites of the main soybean cropping area. BOX-A1R DNA fingerprint distributed these isolates in 10 clades that paralleled the pHs of their original soils. By contrast, reference Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, including those used as soybean-inoculants, were confined to a single clade. More detailed characterization of a subset of 11 SNAP-isolates revealed that five were Bradyrhizobium japonicum, two Bradyrhizobium elkanii, two Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens), one Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, and one Paenibacillus glycanilyticus-which did not nodulate when inoculated alone, and therefore was excluded from further characterization. The remaining subset of 10 SNAP-isolates was used for deeper characterization. All SNAP-isolates were aluminum- and heat-tolerant, and most of them were glyphosate-tolerant. Meanwhile, inoculant strains tested were sensitive to aluminum and glyphosate. In addition, all SNAP-isolates were motile to different degrees. Only three SNAP-isolates were deficient for N2-fixation, and none was intrinsically more competitive than the inoculant strain. These results are in contrast to the general belief that rhizobia from soil populations evolved as intrinsically more competitive for nodulation and less N2-fixing effective than inoculants strains.

In this study, the adaptability and CLas titres of D. citri adults on three weed species, namely, Ageratum conyzoides, Solanum nigrum and Praxelis clematidea, which are widely distributed in citrus orchards in China, were determined.RESULTS: D. citri selected S. nigrum preferentially over the other weed species. The longest survival times of D. citri adults on A. conyzoides, S. nigrum and P. clematidea were 48, 41 and 11days, respectively. On S. nigrum, the survivorship of females was significantly higher than that of males. The CLas titres of D. citri adults feeding on the three weeds for 1week increased significantly during autumn but did not change significantly during spring. Conversely, the titres of adults on citrus increased significantly during spring but did not change significantly during autumn.CONCLUSION: D. citri exhibited different adaptabilities to the three weed species, but the CLas titres of D. citri adults did not decrease on any of the weeds. These results suggested that the three weed species could help dispersing of D. citri and transmission of CLas while ideal host conditions were scarce or absent. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1526-4998,,MEDLINE:33751790,33751790,

It is considered one of the promising crops to overcome the challenges of poverty and hunger worldwide. However, it is exposed to different biotic and abiotic stresses that can cause significant losses in production. Thus, potato is a candidate of special relevance for improvements through conventional breeding and biotechnology. Since conventional breeding is time-consuming and challenging, genetic engineering provides the opportunity to introduce/switch-off genes of interest without altering the allelic combination that characterize successful commercial cultivars or to induce targeted sequence modifications by New Breeding Techniques. There is a variety of methods for potato improvement via genetic transformation. Most of them incorporate genes of interest into the nuclear genome; nevertheless, the development of plastid transformation protocols broadened the available approaches for potato breeding. Although all methods have their advantages and disadvantages, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most used approach. Alternative methods such as particle bombardment, protoplast transfection with polyethylene glycol and microinjection are also effective. Independently of the DNA delivery approach, critical steps for a successful transformation are a rapid and efficient regeneration protocol and a selection system. Several critical factors affect the transformation efficiency: vector type, insert size, Agrobacterium strain, explant type, composition of the subculture media, selective agent, among others. Moreover, transient or stable transformation, constitutive or inducible promoters, antibiotic/herbicide resistance or marker-free strategies can be considered. Although great efforts have been made to optimize all the parameters, potato transformation protocols are highly genotype-dependent. Genome editing technologies provide promising tools in genetic engineering allowing precise modification of targeted sequences. Interestingly, transient expression of genome editing components in potato protoplasts was reported to generate edited plants without the integration of any foreign DNA, which is a valuable aspect from both a scientific and a regulatory perspective. In this review, current challenges and opportunities concerning potato genetic engineering strategies developed to date are discussed. We describe their critical parameters and constrains, and the potential application of the available tools for functional analyses or biotechnological purposes.

As a major legume forage, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) contains little proanthocyanidins in foliage to combat bloat. In an attempt to improve proanthocyanidin content in alfalfa foliage, we over-expressed two MYB transcription factors (CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2) from tea plant that is rich in proanthocyanidins. We showed that, via targeted metabolite and transcript analyses, the transgenic alfalfa plants accumulated higher levels of flavonoids in stems/leaves than the control, in particular anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins.

To condition susceptibility, most plant viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins that interfere with antiviral RNA silencing. The NSs protein is an RNA silencing suppressor in orthotospoviruses, such as the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). The mechanism of RNA silencing suppression by NSs and its role in virus infection and movement are poorly understood. Here, we cloned and tagged TSWV NSs and expressed it from a GFP-tagged turnip mosaic virus (TuMV-GFP) carrying either a wild-type or suppressor-deficient (AS9) helper component proteinase (HC-Pro). When expressed in cis, NSs restored pathogenicity and promoted systemic infection of suppressor-deficient TuMV-AS9-GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivating mutations were introduced in NSs RNA-binding domain one. A genetic analysis with active and suppressor-deficient NSs, in combination with wild-type and mutant plants lacking essential components of the RNA silencing machinery, showed that the NSs insert is stable when expressed from a potyvirus. NSs can functionally replace potyviral HC-Pro, condition virus susceptibility, and promote systemic infection and symptom development by suppressing antiviral RNA silencing through a mechanism that partially overlaps that of potyviral HC-Pro.

Secondary metabolites are formed from large synthase/synthetase enzymes often encoded in gene clusters containing additional enzymes cooperating in the metabolite's biosynthesis. The true potential of fungal metabolomes remain untapped as the majority of secondary metabolite gene clusters are silent under standard laboratory growth conditions. One way to achieve expression of biosynthetic pathways is to clone the responsible genes and express them in a well-suited heterologous host, which poses a challenge since Fusarium polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters can be large (e.g. as large as 80 kb) and comprise several genes necessary for product formation. The major challenge associated with heterologous expression of fungal biosynthesis pathways is thus handling and cloning large DNA sequences. In this paper we present the successful workflow for cloning, reconstruction and heterologous production of two previously characterized Fusarium pseudograminearum natural product pathways in Fusarium graminearum. In vivo yeast recombination enabled rapid assembly of the W493 (NRPS32-PKS40) and the Fusarium Cytokinin gene clusters. F. graminearum transformants were obtained through protoplast-mediated and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Whole genome sequencing revealed isolation of transformants carrying intact copies the gene clusters was possible. Known Fusarium cytokinin metabolites; fusatin, 8-oxo-fusatin, 8-oxo-isopentenyladenine, fusatinic acid together with cis- and trans-zeatin were detected by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which confirmed gene functionality in F. graminearum. In addition the non-ribosomal lipopeptide products W493 A and B was heterologously produced in similar amounts to that observed in the F. pseudograminearum doner. The Fusarium pan-genome comprises more than 60 uncharacterized putative secondary metabolite gene clusters. We nominate the well-characterized F. graminearum as a heterologous expression platform for Fusarium secondary metabolite gene clusters, and present our experience cloning and introducing gene clusters into this species. We expect the presented methods will inspire future endevours in heterologous production of Fusarium metabolites and potentially aid the production and characterization of novel natural products.",,,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,0,7,,,,1096-0937,,MEDLINE:31279974,31279974,

As each of these transport steps might potentially be limiting to efficient nitrogen delivery to the pea embryo, we manipulated both simultaneously.

The green microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was adopted as a useful model organism for studying various physiological systems. Its ability to grow under both photosynthetic and heterotrophic conditions allows efficient growth of non-photosynthetic mutants, making Chlamydomonas a useful genetic tool to study photosynthesis. In addition, this green alga can grow as haploid or diploid cells, similar to yeast, providing a powerful genetic system. As a result, easy and efficient transformation systems have been developed for Chlamydomonas, targeting both the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Since microalgae comprise a rich repertoire of species that offer variable advantages for biotech and biomed industries, gene transfer technologies were further developed for many microalgae to allow for the expression of foreign proteins of interest. Expressing foreign genes in the chloroplast enables the targeting of foreign DNA to specific sites by homologous recombination. Chloroplast transformation also allows for the introduction of genes encoding several enzymes from a complex pathway, possibly as an operon. Expressing foreign proteins in the chloroplast can also be achieved by introducing the target gene into the nuclear genome, with the protein product bearing a targeting signal that directs import of the transgene-product into the chloroplast, like other endogenous chloroplast proteins. Integration of foreign genes into the nuclear genome is mostly random, resulting in large variability between different clones, such that extensive screening is required. The use of different selection modalities is also described, with special emphasis on the use of herbicides and metabolic markers which are considered to be friendly to the environment, as compared to drug-resistance genes that are commonly used. Finally, despite the development of a wide range of transformation tools and approaches, expression of foreign genes in microalgae suffers from low efficiency.

Transgenic cotton lines were evaluated phenotypically and screened for the presence of selectable marker, reporter gene expression, and insertion numbers. Quantitative analysis showed that the patterns of GUS reporter gene activity during fiber development in transgenic cotton lines were similar to those of the native genes. Greenhouse drought and heat stress study showed a correlation between the decrease in promoter activities and decrease in fiber length, increase in micronaire and changes in other fiber quality traits in transgenic lines grown under stressed condition. These newly developed materials provide new molecular tools for studying the effects of abiotic stresses on fiber development and may be used in study of cotton fiber development genes and eventually in the genetic manipulation of fiber quality.",,,,,,,,,7,2,0,0,5,0,9,,,,1932-6203,,MEDLINE:26030401,26030401,

Cytochrome P450 71A13 (CYP71A13) is a key enzyme for camalexin biosynthesis and catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) to IAN. The CYP71A13 gene is located in tandem with its close homolog CYP71A12, also encoding an IAOx dehydratase. However, for CYP71A12, indole-3-carbaldehyde and cyanide were identified as major reaction products. To clarify CYP71A12 function in vivo and to better understand IAN metabolism, we generated two cyp71a12 cyp71a13 double knockout mutant lines. CYP71A12-specific transcription activator-like effector nucleases were introduced into the cyp71a13 background, and very efficient somatic mutagenesis was achieved. We observed stable transmission of the cyp71a12 mutation to the following generations, which is a major challenge for targeted mutagenesis in Arabidopsis. In contrast to cyp71a13 plants, in which camalexin accumulation is partially reduced, double mutants synthesized only traces of camalexin, demonstrating that CYP71A12 contributes to camalexin biosynthesis in leaf tissue. A major role of CYP71A12 was identified for the inducible biosynthesis of ICOOH. Specifically, the ICOOH methyl ester was reduced to 12% of the wild-type level in AgNO3-challenged cyp71a12 leaves. In contrast, indole-3-carbaldehyde derivatives apparently are synthesized via alternative pathways, such as the degradation of indole glucosinolates. Based on these results, we present a model for this surprisingly complex metabolic network with multiple IAN sources and channeling of IAOx-derived IAN into camalexin biosynthesis. In conclusion, transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated mutation is a powerful tool for functional analysis of tandem genes in secondary metabolism.",,,,,,,,,25,4,0,0,26,0,28,,,,1532-2548,,MEDLINE:25953104,25953104,

Our objective in this study was to quantify the spatial variations in direct and indirect contact rates among wild pigs and cattle on a commercial cow-calf operation in Florida, USA. Using GPS data from 20 wild pigs and 11 cattle and a continuous-time movement model, we extracted three types of spatial contacts between wild pigs and cattle, including direct contact, indirect contact in the pastoral environment (unknown naturally occurring resources), and indirect contact via anthropogenic cattle resources (feed supplements and water supply troughs). We examined the effects of sex, spatial proximity, and cattle supplement availability on contact rates at the species level and characterized wild pig usage of cattle supplements. Our results suggested daily pig-cattle direct contacts occurred only occasionally, while a significant number of pig-cattle indirect contacts occurred via natural resources distributed heterogeneously across the landscape. At cattle supplements, more indirect contacts occurred at liquid molasses than water troughs or molasses-mineral block tubs due to higher visitation rates by wild pigs.

Phosphorylation assays show that SnRK1 phosphorylates WRKY3 mainly at Ser83 and Ser112 to destabilize the repressor, and WRKY3 non-phosphorylation-null mutants at these two sites are more stable than the wild-type protein. SnRK1-overexpressing barley plants display enhanced disease resistance to Bgh. Transient expression of SnRK1 reduces fungal haustorium formation in barley cells, which probably requires SnRK1 nuclear localization and kinase activity.

The ability to make specific modifications to a plant's genetic material creates opportunities for rapid development of elite cultivars with desired traits. The plant genome can be altered in several ways, including targeted introduction of nucleotide changes, deleting DNA segments, introducing exogenous DNA fragments and epigenetic modifications. Targeted changes are mediated by sequence specific nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated protein) systems. Recent advances in engineering chimeric Cas nucleases fused to base editing enzymes permit for even greater precision in base editing and control over gene expression. In addition to gene editing technologies, improvement in delivery systems of exogenous DNA into plant cells have increased the rate of successful gene editing events. Regeneration of fertile plants containing the desired edits remains challenging; however, manipulation of embryogenesis-related genes such as BABY BOOM (BBM) has been shown to facilitate regeneration through tissue culture, often a major hurdle in recalcitrant cultivars. Epigenome reprogramming for improved crop performance is another possibility for future breeders, with recent studies on MutS HOMOLOG 1 (MSH1) demonstrating epigenetic-dependent hybrid vigor in several crops.

Despite their economic, cultural, and ecological importance, very little research has been conducted on the viral community that infects them. We previously identified a highly divergent geminivirus that is the first known to infect cacti. Recent research efforts in non-cultivated and asymptomatic plants have shown that the diversity of this viral family has been under-sampled. As a consequence, little is known about the effects and interactions of geminiviruses in many plants, such as cacti. With the objective to expand knowledge on the diversity of geminiviruses infecting cacti, we used previously acquired high-throughput sequencing results to search for viral sequences using BLASTx against a viral RefSeq protein database. We identified two additional sequences with similarity to geminiviruses, for which we designed abutting primers and recovered full-length genomes. From 42 cacti and five scale insects, we derived 42 complete genome sequences of a novel geminivirus species that we have tentatively named Opuntia virus 2 (OpV2) and 32 genomes of an Opuntia-infecting becurtovirus (which is a new strain of the spinach curly top Arizona virus species). Interspecies recombination analysis of the OpV2 group revealed several recombinant regions, in some cases spanning half of the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that OpV2 is a novel geminivirus more closely related to viruses of the genus Curtovirus, which was further supported by the detection of three recombination events between curtoviruses and OpV2. Both OpV2 and Opuntia becurtoviruses were identified in mixed infections, which also included the previously characterized Opuntia virus 1. Viral quantification of the co-infected cactus plants compared with single infections did not show any clear trend in viral dynamics that might be associated with the mixed infections. Using experimental Rhizobium-mediated inoculations, we found that the initial accumulation of OpV2 is facilitated by co-infection with OpV1. This study shows that the diversity of geminiviruses that infect cacti is under-sampled and that cacti harbor diverse geminiviruses. The detection of the Opuntia becurtoviruses suggests spill-over events between viruses of cultivated species and native vegetation. The threat this poses to cacti needs to be further investigated.",,,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,0,5,,,,1999-4915,,MEDLINE:33923787,33923787,

The increased demand will need to be fulfilled by the two main sources of N supply - biological nitrogen (gas) (N2) fixation (BNF) and fertilizer N supplied through the Haber-Bosch processes. BNF provides many functional benefits for agroecosystems. It is a vital mechanism for replenishing the reservoirs of soil organic N and improving the availability of soil N to support crop growth while also assisting in efforts to lower negative environmental externalities than fertilizer N. In cereal-based cropping systems, legumes in symbiosis with rhizobia contribute the largest BNF input; however, diazotrophs involved in non-symbiotic associations with plants or present as free-living N2-fixers are ubiquitous and also provide an additional source of fixed N.

They simulate in situ environmental conditions for the isolation of environmental microbiota through the exchange of growth substrates during cultivation. Here, we introduce leaf-based culture media adopting the concept of the plant being the master architect of the composition of its microbial community. Pre-physical treatments of sunflower plant leaves, namely punching, freezing, and/or autoclavation, allowed the diffusion of electrolytes and other nutrients to configure the leaf surface as a natural pad, i.e., creating an in situ similis environment suitable for the growth of rarely isolated microbiota. We used surface inoculation and membrane-filtration methods to assess the culturability of endophytic bacteria from the sunflower phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Both methods supported excellent colony-forming unit (CFU) development when compared to standard R2A medium, with a special affinity to support better growth of epiphytic and endophytic populations of the phyllosphere compared with the rhizosphere. A 16S rRNA gene analysis of >122 representative isolates indicated the cultivation of a diverse set of microorganisms by application of the new methods. It indicated the predominance of 13 genera of >30 potential species, belonging to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, and especially genera not commonly reported for sunflower, e.g., Rhizobium, Aureimonas, Sphingomonas, Paracoccus, Stenotrophomonas, Pantoea, Kosakonia, and Erwinia. The strategy successfully extended diversity and richness in the endophyllosphere compared to the endorhizosphere, while CFUs grown on the standard R2A medium mainly pertain to Firmicutes, especially Bacillus spp. MALDI-TOF MS analysis clustered the isolates according to their niche and potential functions, where the majority of isolates of the endorhizosphere were clustered away from those of the endophyllosphere. Isolates identified as Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were distinguishably sub-clustered, which was in contrast to the heterogeneous isolates of Firmicutes (Bacillus spp.). In conclusion, leaf in situ similis cultivation is an effective strategy to support the future application of culturomics of plant microbiota. This is an effort to access novel isolates that are more adapted and competitive in their natural environments, especially those subjected to abiotic stresses like those prevailing in arid/semi-arid zones, and, consequently, to support the application of agro-biotechnologies, among other technologies, to improving agriculture in such zones.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,0,3,,,1664-302X,,,MEDLINE:32318031,32318031,

Focus group discussions and key-informant interviews were conducted with veterinarians, para-veterinarians, veterinary academics, farmers and other stakeholders. Vaccination with the Brucella strain 19 vaccine was considered feasible, but the participants were concerned about the risk of self-inoculation, the inability to vaccinate pregnant and male animals, the difficulty to differentiate vaccinated from diseased animals and the challenges of maintaining the vaccine cold chain in India. As expected, the test-and-cull approach was not considered feasible as cattle are considered sacred by Hindus and their slaughter is banned in most states. Although the test-and-segregation approach appears reasonable in theory, it would have low acceptability, if implemented without providing any compensation to farmers. Negligible biosecurity was implemented by farmers: almost no biosecurity procedures were performed for visitors entering a farm, and testing of animals was rarely undertaken before introducing them to a farm. However, the participants considered that improving biosecurity would be more acceptable and feasible than both the test-and-cull and the test-and-segregation approaches. Similarly, inadequate personal protection was used by veterinary personnel for handling parturition, retention of placenta and abortion cases; this was considered as another area of possible improvement. Farmers and veterinarians expressed serious concerns about stray cattle as many of them could potentially be infected with brucellosis, and thus could spread the infection between farms. This study recommends using vaccination and biosecurity along with some ancillary strategies to control brucellosis in India.

This study examined the roles of four ArsR proteins in the well-developed model Gram-negative bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. RNASeq was used to compare and characterize gene expression profiles in ± arsenite-treated cells of the wild-type strain and in four different arsR mutants. We report that ArsR-controlled transcription regulation is truly global, extending well beyond the current ars operon model, and includes both repression as well as apparent activation effects. Many cellular functions are significantly influenced, including arsenic resistance, phosphate acquisition/metabolism, sugar transport, chemotaxis, copper tolerance, iron homeostasis, and many others. While there is evidence of some regulatory overlap, each ArsR exhibits its own regulatory profile. Furthermore, evidence of a regulatory hierarchy was observed; i.e. ArsR1 represses arsR4, ArsR4 activates arsR2, and ArsR2 represses arsR3. Additionally and unexpectedly, aioB (arsenite oxidase small subunit) expression was shown to be under partial positive control by ArsR2 and ArsR4. Summarizing, this study demonstrates the regulatory portfolio of arsenite-activated ArsR proteins and includes essentially all major cellular functions.

Rough Brucella strains, which lack O-PS and are considered less pathogenic, have been introduced to address these drawbacks; however, as Rev.1 confers a much better immunity than the rough mutants, it is still considered the reference vaccine for the prophylaxis of brucellosis in small ruminants. Therefore, developing an improved vaccine strain, which lacks the Rev.1 drawbacks, is a highly evaluated task, which requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence attenuation of Rev.1 smooth strains and of natural Rev.1 rough strains, which are currently only partly understood. As the acidification of the Brucella-containing vacuole during the initial stages of infection is crucial for their survival, identifying the genes that contribute to their survival in an acidic environment versus a normal environment will greatly assist our understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms and the attenuated virulence of the Rev.1 strain. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of the smooth and natural rough Rev.1 strains, each grown under either normal or acidic conditions.

Due to the limited natural availability of these terpenes and the tight regulation of their biosynthesis, there is strong interest to introduce or enhance their production in crop plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. While engineering of monoterpenes has been quite successful, expression of sesquiterpene synthases in engineered plants frequently resulted in production of only minor amounts of sesquiterpenes. To identify bottlenecks for sesquiterpene engineering in plants, we have used two nearly identical terpene synthases, snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) nerolidol/linalool synthase-1 and -2 (AmNES/LIS-1/-2), that are localized in the cytosol and plastids, respectively. Since these two bifunctional terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), their expression in target tissues allows indirect determination of the availability of these substrates in both subcellular compartments. Both terpene synthases were expressed under control of the ripening specific PG promoter in tomato fruits, which are characterized by a highly active terpenoid metabolism providing precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis. As AmNES/LIS-2 fruits produced the monoterpene linalool, AmNES/LIS-1 fruits were found to exclusively produce the sesquiterpene nerolidol. While nerolidol emission in AmNES/LIS-1 fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower compared to linalool emission in AmNES/LIS-2 fruits, accumulation of nerolidol-glucosides in AmNES/LIS-1 fruits was 4- to 14-fold lower than that of linalool-glucosides in AmNES/LIS-2 fruits. These results suggest that only a relatively small pool of FPP is available for sesquiterpene formation in the cytosol. To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK).

The potential for transmission through bovine semen and corresponding effective control procedures are described for bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine leukemia virus, lumpy skin disease virus, bluetongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and Schmallenberg virus. Brief consideration is also provided regarding the potential for transmission via semen of Tritrichomonas foetus, Campylobacter fetus venerealis, Brucella abortus, Leptospira spp., Histophilus somni, Ureaplasma diversum, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Chlamydiaceae, Mycobacterium bovis, Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides and Neospora caninum.

Artificial microRNAs are one common approach, as they have the advantage of producing just a single functional small RNA, which can be designed for high target specificity and low off-target effects. Simultaneous silencing of multiple targets with artificial microRNAs can be achieved by producing polycistronic microRNA precursors. Alternatively, specialized trans-acting short interfering RNA (tasiRNA) precursors can be designed to produce several specific tasiRNAs at once. Here we tested several artificial microRNA- and tasiRNA-based methods for multiplexed gene silencing in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Nicotiana benthamiana. All analyses used transiently expressed transgenes delivered by infiltration of leaves with Agrobacterium tumefacians. Small RNA sequencing analyses revealed that many previously described approaches resulted in poor small RNA processing. The 5'-most microRNA precursor hairpins on polycistronic artificial microRNA precursors were generally processed more accurately than precursors at the 3'-end. Polycistronic artificial microRNAs where the hairpin precursors were separated by transfer RNAs had the best processing precision. Strikingly, artificial tasiRNA precursors failed to be processed in the expected phased manner in our system. These results highlight the need for further development of multiplexed artificial microRNA and tasiRNA strategies. The importance of small RNA sequencing, as opposed to single-target assays such as RNA blots or real-time polymerase chain reaction, is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,2,0,2,,,,1365-313X,,MEDLINE:33655542,33655542,

Vitamin A deficiency is a global health problem that can be alleviated by enriching provitamin A carotenoids in a range of food crops. Suitable plants for biofortification are those with high levels of the provitamin A biosynthetic precursor, lycopene, which is enzymatically converted by lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) to beta-carotene, a provitamin A carotenoid. Crops, such as citrus, naturally accumulate high levels of provitamin A and other health-promoting carotenoids. Such plants may have useful genes to expand the synthetic biology toolbox for producing a range of phenotypes, including both high provitamin A crops and crops with unique compositions of health-promoting carotenoids. To examine enzyme variants having different activity levels, we introduced two citrus LCYB alleles into tomato, a plant with fruit rich in lycopene. Overexpression in tomato of the stronger allele of the citrus chromoplast-specific lycopene beta-cyclase (CsLCYb2a) produced golden transgenic tomato fruits with 9.3-fold increased levels of beta-carotene at up to 1.5 mg/g dry weight. The use of the weaker allele, CsLCYb2b, also led to enhanced levels of beta-carotene but in the context of a more heterogeneous composition of carotenoids. From a synthetic biology standpoint, these allelic differences have value for producing cultivars with unique carotenoid profiles. Overexpression of the citrus LCYB genes was accompanied by increased expression of other genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes and increased size and number of chromoplasts needed to sequester the elevated levels of carotenoids in the transgenic tomato fruits. The overexpression of the citrus LCYB genes also led to a pleiotropic effect on profiles of phytohormones and primary metabolites. Our findings show that enzyme variants are essential synthetic biology parts needed to create a wider range of metabolic engineering products. In this case, strong and weak variants of LCYB proved useful in creating dietary sources to alleviate vitamin A deficiency or, alternatively, to create crops with a heterogeneous composition including provitamin A and healthful, nonprovitamin A carotenoids.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,,1520-5118,,MEDLINE:33073979,33073979,

Current vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from recombinant expression of the immunodominant L1 protein are highly effective in the prevention of cervical infection; however, these vaccines are expensive and type-specific. Therefore, there is a need for more broadly protective and affordable vaccines. The HPV-16 L2 peptide sequences 108-120, 65-81, 56-81, and 17-36 are highly conserved across several HPV types and have been shown to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies. To increase L2 immunogenicity, L1:L2 chimeric VLPs (cVLP) vaccine candidates were developed. The four L2 peptides mentioned above were substituted into the DE loop of HPV-16 L1 at position 131 (SAC) or in the C-terminal region at position 431 (SAE) to generate HPV-16-derived L1:L2 chimeras. All eight chimeras were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated DNA transfer. SAC chimeras predominantly assembled into higher order structures (T = 1 and T = 7 VLPs), whereas SAE chimeras assembled into capsomeres or formed aggregates. Four SAC and one SAE chimeras were used in vaccination studies in mice, and their ability to generate cross-neutralizing antibodies was analyzed in HPV pseudovirion-based neutralization assays. Of the seven heterologous HPVs tested, cross-neutralization with antisera specific to chimeras was observed for HPV-11 (SAE 65-18), HPV-18 (SAC 108-120, SAC 65-81, SAC 56-81, SAE 65-81), and HPV-58 (SAC 108-120).

A number of phage therapy phase I and II clinical trials have concluded, and shown phages don't present significant adverse safety concerns. These clinical trials used simple phage suspensions without any formulation and phage stability was of secondary concern. Phages have a limited stability in solution, and undergo a significant drop in phage titre during processing and storage which is unacceptable if phages are to become regulated pharmaceuticals, where stable dosage and well defined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are de rigueur. Animal studies have shown that the efficacy of phage therapy outcomes depend on the phage concentration (i.e. the dose) delivered at the site of infection, and their ability to target and kill bacteria, arresting bacterial growth and clearing the infection. In addition, in vitro and animal studies have shown the importance of using phage cocktails rather than single phage preparations to achieve better therapy outcomes. The in vivo reduction of phage concentration due to interactions with host antibodies or other clearance mechanisms may necessitate repeated dosing of phages, or sustained release approaches. Modelling of phage-bacterium population dynamics reinforces these points. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the effect of formulation on phage therapy outcomes, given the need for phage cocktails, where each phage within a cocktail may require significantly different formulation to retain a high enough infective dose. This review firstly looks at the clinical needs and challenges (informed through a review of key animal studies evaluating phage therapy) associated with treatment of acute and chronic infections and the drivers for phage encapsulation. An important driver for formulation and encapsulation is shelf life and storage of phage to ensure reproducible dosages. Other drivers include formulation of phage for encapsulation in micro- and nanoparticles for effective delivery, encapsulation in stimuli responsive systems for triggered controlled or sustained release at the targeted site of infection. Encapsulation of phage (e.g. in liposomes) may also be used to increase the circulation time of phage for treating systemic infections, for prophylactic treatment or to treat intracellular infections. We then proceed to document approaches used in the published literature on the formulation and stabilisation of phage for storage and encapsulation of bacteriophage in micro- and nanostructured materials using freeze drying (lyophilization), spray drying, in emulsions e.g. ointments, polymeric microparticles, nanoparticles and liposomes. As phage therapy moves forward towards Phase III clinical trials, the review concludes by looking at promising new approaches for micro- and nanoencapsulation of phages and how these may address gaps in the field.",,,,,,,,,196,5,5,0,151,0,208,,,,1873-3727,,MEDLINE:28688779,28688779,

Of those, 33 isolates from 31 patients were found to have either decreased susceptibility to micafungin and/or an FKS mutation. C. glabrata accounted for the majority of these isolates. While bloodstream infections were found to have a very high mortality rate, isolates from other sites were uncommonly associated with 30-day mortality. Overall resistance rates were very low.Conclusions: Echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata has been increasingly reported but rates at our institution remain very low.

Cottonseed oil also is naturally rich in vitamin E components (collectively known as tocochromanols), with alpha- and gamma-tocopherols comprising nearly all of the vitamin E components. By contrast, cottonseeds have little or no tocotrienols, tocochromanols with a wide range of health benefits. Here, we generated transgenic cotton lines expressing the barley (Hordeum vulgare) homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase coding sequence under the control of the Brassica napus seed-specific promoter, napin. Transgenic cottonseeds had ~twofold to threefold increases in the accumulation of total vitamin E (tocopherols+tocotrienols), with more than 60% gamma-tocotrienol. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging showed that gamma-tocotrienol was localized throughout the transgenic embryos. In contrast, the native tocopherols were distributed unequally in both transgenic and non-transgenic embryos. alpha- Tocopherol was restricted mostly to cotyledon tissues and gamma-tocopherol was more enriched in the embryonic axis tissues. Production of tocotrienols in cotton embryos had no negative impact on plant performance or yield of other important seed constituents including fibre, oil and protein. Advanced generations of two transgenic events were field grown, and extracts of transgenic seeds showed increased antioxidant activity relative to extracts from non-transgenic seeds. Furthermore, refined cottonseed oil from the two transgenic events showed 30% improvement in oxidative stability relative to the non-transgenic cottonseed oil.

We tested how Si supplementation via potassium, sodium or calcium silicate affected a soybean pest, the native budworm Helicoverpa punctigera Wallengren (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Herbivory reduced leaf biomass similarly in Si-supplemented (+Si) and non-supplemented (-Si) plants (c. 29 and 23%, respectively) relative to herbivore-free plants. Both Si supplementation and herbivory increased leaf Si concentrations. In relative terms, herbivores induced Si uptake by c. 19% in both +Si and -Si plants. All Si treatments reduced H. punctigera relative growth rates (RGR) to a similar extent for potassium (-41%), sodium (-49%) and calcium (-48%) silicate. Moreover, there was a strong negative correlation between Si accumulation in leaves and herbivore RGR. To our knowledge, this is only the second report of Si-based herbivore defence in soybean; the rapid increase in leaf Si following herbivory being indicative of an induced defence.

This phloem limited gram-negative bacterium causes dramatic yield losses and is classified into three species based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis (2): (i) 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), the most epidemiologically active, widespread and heat tolerant species; (ii) 'Ca. L. africanus' (Laf), only found in Africa; and (iii) the newly described 'Ca. L. americanus' (Lam), which appeared in 2005 in Brazil (5). Considered as a quarantine organism in America and Europe, Las is actively affecting North America and Asia, and research is leading toward psyllid management and resistance breeding. Despite the fact that Reunion Island has successfully controlled Las by introducing a psyllid parasitoid, Tamarixia radiata (1), this strategy was less effective or reproducible within other territories. D. citri was first detected in Guadeloupe in 1998, where the control of the the psyllid population has been effective with T. radiata (3); and was first detected in Martinique in 2012. Following the outbreak in the United States and the Caribbean, and also supported by reports of symptoms in citrus orchards, local National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPO) organized a detection survey across both islands to verify the occurrence of Huanglongbing. Since 2012, 450 sites were prospected each year in Martinique and Guadeloupe, where 20 leaves from 10 to 30 trees were analyzed. DNA extraction was performed (DNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen) on fresh or dried leaf midribs, along with negative control midribs (Citrus paradisi 'Star Rubis') and PCR amplification was done with the species-specific primers A2/J5 (4) and GB1/GB3 (5). Only Las-specific 703-bp amplicons were obtained (n = 43) and 20 were sequenced (Beckman Coulter Genomics, United Kingdom; sequences available through GenBank Accession Nos. KF699074 to KF699093) and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redondant database (NCBI-nr). BLAST analysis revealed 100% identity with the 50S ribosomal protein subunit L1 (rplA) and L10 (rplJ) of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' (all strains), and no significant homology to other organisms. Additionally, sequence assembly on a reference genome (NC_012985) showed 100% homology. Huanglongbing was detected in Guadeloupe on March 2012 at Le Moule (East coast) in a Tahiti lime orchard (C. latifolia) and crossed the island in 6 months. Las was detected in Martinique on May 2013 on Tahiti lime (C. latifolia) at Bellefontaine (Northwest) in a private garden and at Le Lorrain (Northeast) in an orchard. Other species from the Rutaceae family were affected by HLB (C. reticulat and C. sinensis) on both islands; however, few of the positive samples showed HLB symptoms (blotchy mottle patterns and green islands on leaves), but presented symptoms similar to nutrient deficiencies. Despite the former presence of T. radiata in Guadeloupe and its detection in Martinique a few weeks after the detection of D. citri, where it had a mean parasitism rate of 70%, an outbreak of HLB spread across both islands. These analyses confirm the presence of HLB in Martinique and Guadeloupe and to our knowledge represent the first report of Las in the French West Indies. Introduction events remain unclear, but this report raises the importance of plant certification, psyllid population control, and surveillance of territories close to the French West Indies, with regards to the risk that HLB presents to citrus production worldwide.

The genetically programed structure of plant viruses allows them to be modified by genetic engineering, bioconjugation, or encapsulation to form virus nanoparticles (VNPs) that are suitable for a broad range of applications. Plant VNPs can be used to present foreign proteins or epitopes, to construct inorganic hybrid materials, or to carry molecular cargos, allowing their utilization as imaging reagents, immunomodulators, therapeutics, nanoreactors, and biosensors. The medical applications of plant viruses benefit from their inability to infect and replicate in human cells. The structural properties of plant viruses also make them useful as components of hydrogels for tissue engineering. Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks composed of hydrophilic polymers that can absorb large amounts of water. They are used as supports for tissue regeneration, as reservoirs for controlled drug release, and are found in contact lenses, many wound healing materials, and hygiene products. They are also useful in ecological applications such as wastewater treatment. Hydrogel-based matrices are structurally similar to the native extracellular matrix (ECM) and provide a scaffold for the attachment of cells. To fully replicate the functions of the ECM it is necessary to augment hydrogels with biological cues that regulate cellular interactions. This can be achieved by incorporating functionalized VNPs displaying ligands that influence the mechanical characteristics of hydrogels and their biological properties, promoting the survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of embedded cells.

We evaluated the performance of FP samples from reindeer and caribou in these nine assays after simulating potential challenges of high-latitude field collections: 1) different durations of storage and 2) different processing/storage regimes involving freezing or drying. Sample pairs (serum and FP) were collected from reindeer and caribou populations in 2007-10 and were tested in duplicate. Comparable performance to serum was defined as sensitivity and specificity ≥ 80%. In the storage experiments, FP performance was determined after 2 mo of storage dry at room temperature, and after two longer periods (variable depending on assay; up to 2 yr). After 1 yr, compared to frozen serum stored for the same period, sensitivity was ≥ 88% for all but two assays (68% BHV-1; 75% PI-3), and specificity remained >90%. A limited trial evaluated the effect of freezing FP samples as opposed to drying them for storage. There were no observed detrimental effects of freezing on FP sample performance, but rigorous investigation is warranted.",,,,,,,,,18,0,1,0,16,0,19,,,,1943-3700,,MEDLINE:24499329,24499329,

The formation of GKPtNP was confirmed by ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The formed GKPtNP are well dispersed, homogeneous with a size of 2-4±0.50 nm, having a negative zeta potential (-46.1 mV) indicating good stability. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) was loaded onto the synthesised GKPtNP, which leads to the development of a new combination of nanomedicine (5FU-GKPtNP). The in vitro drug release studies of 5FU-GKPtNP in pH 7.4 showed a sustained release profile over a period of 120 min. Agrobacterium tumefaciens induced in vitro potato tumour bioassay was employed for screening the anti-tumour potentials of GKPtNP, 5FU, and 5FU-GKPtNP. The experimental results suggested a complete tumour inhibition by 5FU-GKPtNP at a lower concentration than the GKPtNP and 5FU. Furthermore, the mechanism of anti-tumour activity was assessed by their interactions with DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis and UV-spectroscopic analysis. The electrophoresis results revealed that the 5FU-GKPtNP totally diminishes DNA and the UV-spectroscopic analysis showed a hyperchromic effect with red shift indicating intercalation type of binding with DNA. Over all, the present study revealed that the combined exposure of the nanoformulation resulted in the enhanced anti-tumour effect.",,,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,0,3,,,,1751-875X,,MEDLINE:31053691,31053691,

With the anti-cancer prodrug CB1954, both enzymes were more effective than the canonical O2-insensitive nitroreductase E.coli NfsB (NfsB_Ec),NfsA_Nm exhibiting comparable levels of activity to the leading nitroreductase candidate E. coli NfsA (NfsA_Ec). NfsA_Nm is also the first NfsA-family nitroreductase shown to produce a substantial proportion of 4-hydroxylamine end-product. NfsA_Nm and PnbA_Bh were again more efficient than NfsB_Ec at aerobic activation of metronidazole to a cytotoxic form, with NfsA_Nm appearing a promising candidate for improving zebrafish-targeted cell ablation models. NfsA_Nm was also more active than either NfsA_Ec or NfsB_Ec with 2,4- or 2,6-dinitrotoluene substrates, whereas PnbA_Bh was relatively inefficient with either substrate.CONCLUSIONS: NfsA_Nm is a promising new nitroreductase candidate for several diverse biotechnological applications.",,,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,6,0,8,,,,1573-6776,,MEDLINE:29147875,29147875,

Community fingerprinting comparisons and 16S rDNA sequence identifications were used for characterization of the bacterial population using specific primers. The bacterial characterization of soil samples revealed four major phyla: Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In situ (desert) samples of both rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric bulk soil were dominated by the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, whereas the phylum Betaproteobacteria was present only in non-rhizospheric bulk soil. Ex situ (nursery growing condition) V. pachyceras resulted in restricted bacterial communities dominated by members of a single phylum, Bacteroidetes. Results indicated that the soil organic matter and rhizospheric environments might drive the bacterial community. Despite harsh climatic conditions, data demonstrated that V. pachyceras roots harbor endophytic bacterial populations. Our findings on bacterial community composition and structure have major significance for evaluating how Kuwait's extreme climatic conditions affect bacterial communities. The baseline data obtained in this study will be useful and assist in formulating strategies in ecological restoration programs, including the application of inoculation technologies.",,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,,,,1480-3275,,MEDLINE:30495976,30495976,

However, the underlying synergistic mechanism of the herb pair remains unknown. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma volatile oil on the pharmacokinetic parameters of xanthotoxol, oxypeucedanin hydrate, and byakangelicin from Angelicae Dahuricae Radix in rat, and in vitro absorption behavior of the three compounds using rat everted gut sac, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion, and Caco-2 cell monolayer models. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited clear changes in the key pharmacokinetic parameters of the three main coumarins through co-administering with Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma volatile oil (50mg/kg), the area under curve and the maximum plasma concentration of xanthotoxol increased 1.36 and 1.31 times; the area under curve, the maximum plasma concentration, mean residence time, half-life of elimination, and the time to reach peak concentration of oxypeucedanin hydrate increased by 1.35, 1.18, 1.24, 1.19 and 1.49 times, respectively; the area under curve, mean residence time, half-life of elimination, and time to reach peak concentration of byakangelicin climbed 1.29, 1.27, 1.37, and 1.28 times, respectively. The three coumarin components were absorbed well in the jejunum and ileum in the intestinal perfusion model, when co-administered with Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma volatile oil (100 mug/mL). The in vivo and in vitro experiments showed good relevance and consistency. The results demonstrated that the three coumarin compounds from Angelicae Dahuricae Radix were absorbed through the active transportation, and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma volatile oil could promote the intestinal absorption and transport of these compounds by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux.",,,,,,,,,5,2,0,0,3,0,7,,,,1615-9314,,MEDLINE:32222035,32222035,
